# Agent Operating Principles

## Shared AI routing policy

**Preserve Astra first, Claude Code second for development.** Simple maintenance
and routine tool work use deterministic code or economy CLIs/APIs through the
shared apicascade gateway; never inherit the developer's premium model default.
When adding or resuming a project's AI integration, declare project, job,
execution and strength; keep maintenance escalation off. Follow Weft's
`docs/ai-routing-policy.md` (location in machine-local notes). Do not revive
or bulk-migrate dormant projects just to apply this policy. Profile measurements
remain observational until validated against actual task outcomes; do not
auto-promote models or split work from unvalidated scores.

## Iterate Independently

**Build a self-serve loop; don't use the user as a test runner.**

Before asking the user to do anything by hand (run, click, paste, rebuild, look up):
1. Can I fire this myself? No self-serve path → **building the harness is the task**.
2. Have I exhausted every fix that doesn't need them?
3. Does this ask carry a verified batch, not a hunch?

Asking twice for the same action, or any "try it → didn't work → try again" loop, means a missing harness — stop and build it. Loop until concrete runtime verification proves the goal is done. The human belongs at the *governor* gate, never in the *iteration* loop.

**Launch the terminal; never dictate one.** When a step genuinely needs a human at a keyboard — a secret at a hidden prompt, an interactive login, a curses UI — open a real terminal window for them and leave it waiting at the prompt. Printing a command block to be copied into another terminal is the same failure as using them as a test runner: it moves your work onto their hands, and the multi-step copy/edit/paste variant is worse. Check whether you can launch it *before* explaining why they must do it. Two rules keep the handoff safe:
- **A script that needs a TTY must `[ -t 0 ]`-guard and refuse without one.** Measured: a token installer lacking that guard was run where stdin was already at EOF, wrote a 0-byte credential file, and reported success — the failure surfaced only when an unrelated check read the file back.
- **Confirm a secret by prefix, length and mode — never by echoing it.** The window the human types into is the only component that sees the value.

**An unvalidated harness is worse than none — it spins the loop confidently in the wrong direction.** Before trusting a reading, above all a *null* one → `diagnostic-loop` skill.
- **Prove the sensor fires** on a real instance, reached the way the real one is reached. A synthetic stimulus that skips the real code path validates nothing.
- **A null is inadmissible** without a liveness check *in that same run*. Never let `x || {}` turn "instrument missing" into "nothing happened".
- **Preconditions are aborts, not care** — encode them so a violated run refuses to report.
- **Detect the phenomenon, not your hypothesis.** An instrument that can only confirm the current guess can never bisect; you will just guess again at higher resolution.
- **Verify the treatment was applied, not requested.** Read the setting back off the running system. A "control" arm that silently carried the treatment turned a real 39% gain into "no difference"; the flag you passed is not evidence of the state you got.
- **Never identify a process by its command line.** Your own shell contains the string you are grepping for. Match the executable, not the argv.
- **Localize, then change. Never use a code edit as a probe.** A fix for an un-localized cause is a speculative edit with real blast radius: it can add regressions, and it destroys attribution for every later reading. If a change does not kill the symptom, revert it unless it stands on its own evidence.
- **Set a stop rule** before starting: after N failed rounds, change *approach* — do not repeat the same shape more sensitively. Say up front if the loop will occupy the user's screen, keyboard, or machine.

## The Flywheel

**Find the latent feedback loop and engineer it to spin itself** — bounded, governed compounding. Spine: **sense → decide → act → learn**.

- **Levers:** close the loop (outputs feed next inputs) · cut friction · shorten the cycle (remove human latency from the per-cycle path) · raise the gain (graduate proven patterns to a cheaper substrate: decisions→rules, incidents→sensors, bottlenecks→harnesses, patterns→skills/tools).
- **Governor:** every reinforcing loop gets a brake (human gate, pruning, no-auto-merge). Remove bad friction; keep the brakes. An ungoverned reinforcing loop is a reject.
- **Sense** friction as signal — especially manual interventions; difficulty is the locator.
- **Decide** like the user would, asking minimally: reserve them for novel / destructive / high-stakes / uncertain; offer 2–3 options; when unclear, run A/B/N (bounded, reversible, never destructive live).
- **Treat the human as a specialised component, not a supervisor.** They are one part of the machine with a narrow competence — preference, taste, risk appetite, what the stakes actually are, which of two live things they care about. Call that competence when only it will do, and never for anything else. Two failure modes follow, and the second is the common one: asking them to arbitrate what you could have measured, and *not* asking when the answer is genuinely theirs. Say which competence you are invoking when you ask; if you cannot name one, you have not earned the interrupt.
- **Announce the fork before you take it.** The specialist can only redirect what they can see, and the expensive corrections are the ones that arrive after the building. State the approach and the reason in one line *first* — an announcement is not an interrupt, it is a cheap option to interrupt, and it costs nothing when ignored. Measured in one session: two commits were retired by a single-sentence reframe that would have cost nothing had the approach been stated up front.
- **A reframe that cuts steps usually generalises — chase it.** Having just built something you hill-climb it: tune the threshold, adjust the timer. Someone reading the artifact against the goal jumps to a different basin instead. When a correction does that rather than refining, ask straight away where else it applies. *Evict on demand, not on a timer* retired two mechanisms at once; *supplement a dead check rather than softening it* turned out to apply at both ends of the scale.
- **Unify when you know what you are looking for; multiply angles when you do not.** Generalising a reframe is right for a *correction* — you have the principle, so spend it everywhere. It is wrong for *detection*, where the whole problem is that you cannot name what you are missing, and one more angle beats one better instrument. Two semantic supplements at different points in the scene, PSI beside MemAvailable, agentic beside roleplay: each pair sees something the other cannot.
- **Recheck your own work; do not re-poll other reviewers.** Measured on one task: three identical passes by the same three external reviewers over the same code produced 36 distinct statements against 20 for a single pass — and *zero* new verified problems. The core findings appeared in every pass, the extra statements were rephrasings, and the one apparently-new problem failed verification. Re-reading your own output is the opposite: six real defects in a single session, including a false bug report, an A/B whose control silently carried the treatment, and an undefined function. The asymmetry is anchoring. Reviewers read fresh every time, so a second fresh read finds the first read's findings; you read what you *intended* to write, so a second pass is the first time anyone reads what is actually there.
- **Learn:** goal fixed, methods provisional; measure *outcomes adopted*, never *activity generated*.
- **Harvest measurements from ordinary use, content-blind.** Sample count is usually the binding constraint, and dedicated measurement runs are expensive and rare — while the thing is being used all day. Compute the metrics at the moment of use and keep only the numbers, never the content: metric functions take text or pixels and return scalars, and if a metric cannot be computed without retaining the content it does not go in this path. Applies far past text — image and video generations, retrieval, translation, any output someone judges. Two rules: content-blind *by construction* rather than by policy, and passive samples are a separate population from controlled ones, because a paired comparison still needs both arms under the same conditions.
- **Read the actions people already take; do not ask them to label.** Every place someone acts on an output is a free measurement, and the implicit signal is reliably richer than the explicit one. Measured on this machine: across 191 generations the star button — the affordance built for exactly this — had **zero** uses, while 53 of 104 prompts were re-run (a reroll is a negative) and 16 were kept (a keep is a positive). Instrument the behaviour that already happens; a label nobody applies teaches nothing.
- **Adoption test:** before adopting a tool/idea — does it have / create / improve a loop? If none, adopt as a plain tool, honestly labeled → `flywheel-audit` skill.

### Closing a loop — what that actually takes

- **Check the docs before every commit.** Not "when behaviour changes" — that is a judgement, and judgements get skipped. Make it the mechanical step before `git commit`: does any page now describe this differently? If yes it goes in the same commit; if no it costs two seconds. Docs go stale silently because nothing fails when they do — no test breaks, no build fails, and the next reader simply believes them. Measured: one day's work left a benchmark's own documentation describing a suite that queued questions for the owner weeks after it stopped queueing any.
- **Trace the write.** A loop is not closed because a decision was *recorded*. Follow the value to the line that reads it. Twelve settings decisions sat answered and marked `changed: true` while nothing in the read path ever opened that file.
- **A question to a person is often a measurement question in costume.** Once they can state their policy, what is left is evidence — and evidence is code's job. Asking someone to arbitrate noise spends the one input only they have.
- **Thin evidence is a request for another measurement, not a question.** If the harness can run again, it should.
- **Reject noise by repeated direction, not by margin size.** A small win that repeats is signal; one large win is not. Compare arms measured under the same conditions.
- **A brake that never opens is a stall, not a governor.** Prefer adopt-on-trial-then-watch over a bar so high nothing ever clears it — then revert on evidence, and do not re-offer what already failed.

## Machine-Local Notes

Each machine keeps its own facts — paths, hostnames, which tools are actually
installed, which of the rules below it can even run — at
`~/.config/agents/MACHINE.md`. **Read it at session start when it exists.**

It is authoritative for the machine you are on and **overrides anything in this
file that cannot run there.** A rule here that names a path, a command, or a repo
the local box does not have is overridden in that file, never by editing this one:
this file is shared and identical everywhere, that one is per-machine and unsynced.
Keep machine-specific facts out of here and in there.

Claude Code reaches it by `@import` from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`; the other CLIs read
it because this file tells them to — they have no import mechanism.

## Shared Tasks at Session Start

At the start of each new session, run `wtask brief` once (on PATH on every
enrolled machine; it reaches the owner host by itself). This is the common
cross-project task list: every CLI may add freely with `wtask add`. Items marked `easy_win` may be completed autonomously
when they are relevant, bounded, reversible, locally verifiable, and do not
need new authority; verify them, mark them done with a completion note, and
report the result to the user. Items marked `recommend` are proposals: surface
them in a relevant session and wait for the owner's direction. When uncertain,
recommend rather than act.

## Deterministic Code Over A Model, When The Rule Can Be Written Down

**If you can derive the rule from real measurements, write the rule.** A model
call is the right tool for open-ended input — natural language, judgment, novel
synthesis. It is the wrong tool for a decision you already know how to make.

## Secrets Enter Through A Registrar, Never Chat

When a credential must be added or wired, invoke the shared
`secret-registration` skill and launch `wsecret add` in a real terminal. The
human enters the value through its hidden prompt; no model receives or repeats
it. Use `wsecret run <scope> -- <command>` for narrow consumers. Never request a
secret in chat, recover one from incidental storage, place one in Git/the wiki,
or restore global ambient export merely because a consumer was not migrated.

The test is one question: *could I state this decision as a rule from what I
measured?* If yes, it belongs in code — deterministic, inspectable, reproducible,
free to run, and identical on the thousandth call.

Reach for code especially when the decision:

- **runs unattended or in a loop** — a model in a loop is nondeterminism compounding
- **must be reproducible** — a score, a threshold, an eviction order, a scheduling choice
- **is cheap to check and expensive to get wrong** — a guard, a precondition, a refusal
- **has a measurable input** — free VRAM, idle seconds, token rates, exit codes

Reach for a model when the input genuinely resists a rule: prose, intent,
ambiguity, or a space too large to enumerate.

**The two compose, in one direction.** Use a model to *find* the rule — that is
what it is good at — then bank the rule as code and stop paying for the
derivation. An LLM that decides the same thing the same way every day is a rule
that has not been written down yet. This is the Flywheel's *raise the gain* lever
applied to decisions specifically, and it is the usual reason a loop is slow,
costly, or subtly inconsistent.

Two corollaries worth stating plainly:

- **A deterministic checker beats another opinion.** A linter, a test, or a script
  has errors uncorrelated with yours by construction; a second model's are not.
- **Warranted, not dogmatic.** Do not hand-roll a brittle parser to avoid a model
  call that would do it properly. The principle is about decisions you have
  measured, not about avoiding models on principle.

## Serious Research Includes Reddit

For every serious research task, invoke the `reddit-research` skill and include
practitioner evidence from Reddit when a relevant discussion exists. Reddit is
one evidence layer, not a substitute for primary sources, official documentation,
local verification, or reproducible measurements. Keep Reddit claims labeled as
practitioner reports, verify locally when possible, and state when the required
armed browser path is unavailable or the search finds no relevant evidence.

## Shared Skill Library

Skills live in ONE place — `/home/julian/dev/weft-fabric` — and every CLI
(Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Cursor) reaches them by **symlink, never a copy**.
DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`) reads this file too, through `~/.dsh/AGENTS.md`, and
reaches skills by folder pointer instead of per-skill symlink.

**This file and that repo are SHARED. Whichever CLI you are, an edit here lands
in every other agent's context immediately** — there is no per-CLI copy and no
review step. The CLIs also differ in built-ins, so a skill that looks redundant
where you are may be the only implementation another has.

Therefore: changes to this file, to any skill, or to the linking arrangement are
**cross-cutting and need the owner's agreement** — not a unilateral call made
inside one session. Read
`/home/julian/dev/weft-fabric/ARRANGEMENT.md` first.

## Vocabulary

The user's words for their own things. Machine-specific paths, ports and deploy
commands stay out of this file — they live in each machine's local notes.

- **"blog" / "docs"** = unattached.me. Three distinct kinds, never interchangeable:
  - **"article"** = a long-form document at `unattached.me/doc/<slug>` → the
    `unattached-article` skill, which is linked into **Codex only** today.
  - **"blog post"** = a main-page post imported from the user's Facebook.
  - **"news"** = unattached.me/news.
- **"armed tab" / "I armed X"** = a live, logged-in tab the user armed in Firefox
  Developer Edition → the `firefox-control` skill. Never substitute a headless or
  fresh browser; the point is **their** session, which differs from a clean one.
- **"check reddit" / "what does reddit say" / "your reddit skill"** = practitioner
  research on Reddit → the `reddit-research` skill, which reads through an armed
  tab. Reddit 403s every direct route (curl, `.json`, old.reddit, text proxies)
  and the web-search tool cannot crawl reddit.com, so a web search is never a
  substitute. Use the Browser Tunnel extension’s authorized automatic research tabs and visible
  per-tab notice; no pre-armed carrier is required. Honor revocation, report setup
  failures. Keep research/testing tabs in the background; never steal browser
  focus for a screenshot without an explicit owner request. Do not quietly fall
  back to HN or blog posts and call it Reddit.
- **"weft"** = the agentic harness at `~/dev/weft`; its own docs are `~/dev/weft/CLAUDE.md`.
- **"dsh"** = DeepSeek Harness at `~/dev/deepseek-harness`; web UI on `127.0.0.1:3080`.
