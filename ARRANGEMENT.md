# The shared skill library — how this is wired, and why

**Read this before changing anything about skills, and do not change the
arrangement unilaterally.** This repo is not one agent's config. It is the
shared library for **Claude Code, Codex, Gemini/Antigravity and Cursor** on this
machine.

## 0. Every edit here is global, whichever CLI makes it

There is **one copy of everything** and every CLI is symlinked to it. So:

- Editing `principles/AGENTS.md` from Codex changes what **Claude and Gemini**
  load on their very next session.
- Editing a `SKILL.md` from Claude Code changes the skill **Codex** runs.
- Deleting a skill removes it from **every** CLI at once.
- Re-pointing a symlink changes behaviour for that CLI **silently** — nothing
  logs it, nothing reviews it, and the next agent inherits it as if it were
  always so.

There is no per-CLI copy, no staging, and no review step. The blast radius of
any change is *all four agents*, immediately.

**So treat these as shared, owner-governed files.** Fix an outright bug (a
broken path, a dangling symlink, a stale command) freely. But adding, retiring,
restructuring, or re-linking — and any edit to `principles/AGENTS.md`, which is
loaded into every session of every CLI — is a decision for the owner, not one
to make inside a single session because it looked right from there.

A change that is obviously right for one CLI is frequently wrong for another,
and the failure is silent: nobody notices a skill went missing from a CLI they
weren't using that day. That has already happened twice — see §2 and §1.

**How this layout gets onto a machine and stays right — including troubleshooting — is in [FLEET.md](FLEET.md).** This file covers what the layout is and why it is owner-governed.

                              loads AGENTS.md from ancestor dirs, so its `post`
                              adapter lists ~/AGENTS.md in claudeMdExcludes —

                              Claude Code @imports it from ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.
```

### Convergence: one command, run constantly

`wagent` is the one public tool. Its internal reconciler is the only thing that writes those symlinks. It is
idempotent — every run reconciles this machine with the repo, and a second run
changes nothing — which is why the same command is the installer, the hourly
timer, and the repair tool. There is deliberately no separate install path that
runs once and rots.

```
wagent status                 whole-fleet health
wagent sync                   converge every reachable machine
wagent sync --local           converge this machine
wagent enroll <host>          completely add a machine
wagent doctor                 explain local live wiring
wagent version                release, compatibility protocol, and build

tools/            symlinked into ~/.local/bin by agentsync
  wagent          the public Weft Fabric command
  wsecret         scoped secret registrar (stdlib-only, portable)
  wtask           shared task list; runs locally if the weft repo is here,
                  otherwise over ssh to the owner host
  wnote, wrecall  symlinks to wtask (it dispatches on its invoked name): bank
                  to / recall from the vault wiki with the same local-else-ssh rule
  wmachine        enrol a whole machine from the owner host
  wfleet          which machines are converged, and sync them
  updateall       update every package manager present (apt/dnf/snap/flatpak/
                  npm/pipx/brew/fwupd); only firmware and release upgrades ask
```

The older `agentsync`, `wfleet`, and `wmachine` names are compatibility aliases,
not separate user interfaces.

`agentsync` is also the only configuration state sensor. Fleet tools and UIs
consume its versioned JSON check output rather than hardcoding CLI names or
treating a matching Git commit as proof that live wiring is correct.
CLI-specific exceptions use structured check/apply adapters in
`cli-targets.json`, never opaque post-install commands.

**Adding a CLI is data, not code.** `cli-targets.json` holds every CLI's
instruction path, link method, and skills dir. Add an entry, commit, and every
machine wires it up on its next sync. Nothing hardcodes CLI paths any more —
`scripts/deploy-principles.sh` is a shim kept only for the `--uninstall` path.

`wvault` and `weft-vault-mcp` are deliberately **not** in this repo: `wtoken
install` already distributes them over ssh, privately, and they carry the vault
endpoint and auth header. Minting authority (`wtoken`) stays on the owner host.

### Cursor

Cursor has no global instruction file (probed twice: `~/.cursor/AGENTS.md` and
`~/.cursor/rules/*.mdc` are invisible). It walks ancestors for `AGENTS.md`, so
`~/AGENTS.md` covers projects **under `$HOME`** and nothing outside it — a
project in `/mnt/c` loads none of it.

`cursor/*.mdc` are therefore installed per project, as symlinks, by
`scripts/install-cursor-rule.sh --all`, which `agentsync` runs as cursor's
`post` step:

- `shared-skill-library.mdc` — the no-copies contract for editing skills.
- `shared-principles.mdc` — points at `principles/AGENTS.md` *and*
  `~/.config/agents/MACHINE.md`, because an `.mdc` cannot import and copying
  them in would drift.

Roots come from `~/.config/agents/cursor-roots` (machine-local), defaulting to
`~/dev`. The script also reports Cursor projects no root covers, so the gap is
visible instead of silent.

**Machine-specific facts do not belong in this repo.** A path, hostname, or
"tool X is missing here" that is true on one box and false on another must live in
that box's `~/.config/agents/MACHINE.md`, never in `principles/AGENTS.md` — which
is byte-identical everywhere by design. When a shared rule cannot run on a machine
(it names `~/dev/weft` on a box without it, say), the machine's own file overrides
it. Editing the shared file to accommodate one machine breaks the other two.

**A copy is a bug.** It drifts from the repo silently and it is unbacked. This
has already happened: Codex held 11 copies, 8 of them byte-identical duplicates
of repo skills under renamed directories, and **3 that existed nowhere else at
all** — one `rm -rf ~/.codex` from permanent loss. A fourth had quietly drifted
to a stale version of a skill that had since been fixed.

Check for regressions:

```bash
for d in ~/.claude/skills ~/.codex/skills ~/.gemini/config/skills; do
  for f in "$d"/*/; do [ -L "${f%/}" ] || echo "COPY (fix this)  $f"; done
done
```

**Link every skill under its canonical name. Aliases are not free.** Weft
Fabric discovers eligible plugin skills on every convergence run for every CLI
with a skills directory, Claude Code included (since 2026-09-04; before that
Claude was left to its marketplace, and the marketplace hands out *copies*
pinned to a commit — exactly the stale-copy failure above). Adding a skill does
not require hand-linking it on any machine. The one exception is a plugin that
ships `hooks/`: Claude Code runs hooks only for an installed plugin, so those
(today: `skill-detectors`) are installed from the marketplace, and their skills
are *not* symlinked for Claude, or they would appear twice. The reconciler
enforces both halves: it installs hook plugins and uninstalls marketplace
copies of everything else.

Cursor's discovery surface is the **union of all three directories** — it reads
`~/.cursor/skills-cursor` *and* `~/.claude/skills` *and* `~/.codex/skills`
(verified 2026-08-08 by asking it to list its skills: 30 entries from all three).

So a skill linked in two directories under two different names appears **twice**
in Cursor's surface. Codex historically called `design-taste-frontend`
"taste-skill", `gpt-taste` "gpt-tasteskill", and so on; each of those cost a
duplicate entry. Renamed to canonical on 2026-08-08 — Cursor dedupes by name, so
the count dropped 31 → 30 with nothing lost.

The corollary matters for pruning: the attention cost of a skill linked in both
Claude and Codex is paid **twice over** in Cursor. Linking a skill into a CLI
that will never invoke it is not harmless.

## 2. The CLIs do not have the same features

This is the rule most likely to be broken by a well-meaning agent.

| | Claude Code | Codex | Gemini/Antigravity | Cursor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Built-in code review | `/code-review`, `/simplify` | — | — | — |
| Built-in security review | `/security-review` | — | — | — |
| Built-in browser control | `claude-in-chrome` | — | — | — |
| Plugin marketplace | yes (`unatt` registered) | no | no | no |
| Skill discovery | marketplace + `~/.claude/skills` | `~/.codex/skills` | `~/.gemini/config/skills` | union of `~/.cursor/skills-cursor` (managed, do not link) + `~/.claude/skills` + `~/.codex/skills` — see §1 |
| Output styles | yes — `~/.claude/output-styles` | — | — | — |
| Loads `principles/AGENTS.md` | **yes** — `@import` in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | **yes** — `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` symlink | **yes** — `~/.gemini/AGENTS.md` symlink | **yes** — per-project rule (see below) |

All four verified empirically on 2026-08-08, each asked from a scratch directory
outside any project whether the text was in its context. Claude, Codex and
Antigravity (`agy`) load it automatically and quoted it back. Cursor answered
"NO" until the per-project rule below was installed, then quoted it too.

**So a fresh agent needs no opener.** It is already there before your first
message. To re-check after any change:

```bash
codex exec --skip-git-repo-check "One line: anything in your context about a shared skill library or ARRANGEMENT.md? Quote it, or say NO."
agy -p          "One line: ...same question..."
cursor-agent -p --trust "One line: ...same question..."
```

**A skill is only redundant if it is redundant everywhere.** `security-review`
and `code-quality` duplicate Claude Code commands — and are the *only*
implementation Codex and Gemini have. They were deleted once on Claude-only
reasoning and had to be restored.

When a skill's value is conditional, say so in its frontmatter rather than
leaving the next reader to work it out:

```yaml
clis: codex, gemini, cursor
clis-why: Claude Code ships its own /security-review; this covers the rest.
```

Absent `clis:`, a skill is assumed to apply everywhere.

### Cursor: wired via a per-project rule (2026-08-08)

Cursor has **no global instruction file** — `~/.cursor/AGENTS.md` and
`~/.cursor/rules/*.mdc` are both invisible to it (probed with markers). What it
does read, per project, is `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, and
`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`.

So the contract is installed per project as a **symlink** to
`cursor/shared-skill-library.mdc` in this repo — edit the canonical file and
every project follows. `.cursor/rules/` was chosen over `AGENTS.md` because
several repos already have an `AGENTS.md` owned by something else (weft's
diverges from upstream Hermes and is rebase-sensitive); this adds a
Cursor-only file and touches nothing existing.

```bash
scripts/install-cursor-rule.sh --all      # every git repo directly under ~/dev
scripts/install-cursor-rule.sh ~/dev/foo  # or one at a time
```

Run it for any new repo. The symlink is excluded per-repo via
`.git/info/exclude` (machine-local — an absolute path to this machine has no
business in a shared `.gitignore`).

### Cursor's own skills dir is still off-limits

`~/.cursor/skills-cursor/` is **Cursor's own managed directory**. It carries a
`.sync-manifest.json` with a `lastSyncedAt` per skill and holds Cursor's shipped
skills (`babysit`, `canvas`, `create-hook`, `create-rule`, `create-skill`,
`create-subagent`, `loop`, `migrate-to-skills`, `rename-chat`, `review`, …).
Cursor re-syncs it, so anything symlinked in is liable to be clobbered — and the
copies there are Cursor's to manage, not drift for us to "fix".

If this library should reach Cursor, do it through a per-project `AGENTS.md`
rather than by writing into that directory. Ask the owner first; it is not
wired today and that may be deliberate.

### DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`) is the fifth reader (2026-08-16)

`~/.dsh/AGENTS.md` is a symlink to `principles/AGENTS.md`, so `dsh` loads the
shared principles exactly as Codex and Antigravity do. The filename is fixed;
`$DSH_HOME` moves the directory.

Its skill roots, in the order it scans them, are `<projectRoot>/.dsh/skills`,
`<projectRoot>/.agents/skills`, the configured `customSkillDirs`, `~/.dsh/skills`
and `~/.agents/skills`. It accepts `<name>/SKILL.md` bundles and flat `<name>.md`
files, resolves symlinked entries, and does not recurse. Verified 2026-08-16: a
real `dsh` run listed two skills symlinked into a scratch project, `ste` included,
so the extra `clis:` frontmatter does not break its parser.

Wired on 2026-08-16 through `~/.dsh/cordis.patch.yml`, which points
`customSkillDirs` at `principles/skills` and `plugins/devops/skills`. Prefer that
over per-skill symlinks here: it points at a whole folder, so a new skill in it
appears with no relinking. Nothing else in this library has that property. A real
session lists all six skills from those two folders.

`dsh` has **no plugin marketplace for skills and no output styles**. Do not try
to register the `unatt` marketplace with it.

Open question: the `clis:` frontmatter vocabulary has no `dsh` value, so
`clis: claude` does not exclude a skill from any folder `dsh` is pointed at.

### Output styles are Claude-only, and they live beside their skill

`~/.claude/output-styles/*.md` is a Claude Code feature the other three do not
have. A style ships next to the skill that documents it — `ste-partial.md` sits
under `plugins/content/skills/ste/` — because the style ends by pointing its
reader at that skill for the word list and worked examples. Two homes means one
drifts from the other.

`scripts/deploy-output-styles.sh`, run by `bootstrap.sh`, symlinks them into
`~/.claude/output-styles/`. *Selecting* one stays machine-local: `/output-style`,
stored as `outputStyle` in `~/.claude/settings.json`. Available is not active.

### The tunnel is the load-bearing one

`firefox-control` drives the user's **live, authenticated Firefox tab** through
weft's `looking_glass.py` relay (127.0.0.1:8770) plus the Browser Tunnel
extension. **No CLI and no model has this natively.** Built-in browser tools
(`claude-in-chrome`, Playwright, a Chrome bridge) all drive a *fresh throwaway
browser with no session* — a different capability, not a substitute. Link it
into every CLI; never treat it as redundant with a built-in.

Cautionary tale: `frontend/browser` was retained on 2026-08-08 partly on the
assumption it might be the tunnel. It was not — it described a **Chrome** bridge
on port 8787 requiring a Chrome extension, and on this machine nothing listens
on 8787 and Chrome is not installed. It documented infrastructure that does not
exist. Retired. The test that settles this class of question is not "which CLI
has a built-in" but **"does the infrastructure this skill needs actually exist
here"**.

## 3. What earns a place here

A skill is worth keeping only if it carries something **the model does not
already know**. The models improve every few months; skills do not. Three
things qualify:

1. **This machine** — paths, ports, service names, which binary is the right one,
   what breaks and why. `firefox-control` and `sudo-run` are the shape to copy:
   short instructions wrapped around a real script.
2. **Volatile facts** the model would get wrong from memory — prices, model IDs,
   API shapes. `llm-api-pricing` ships a data file and refuses to answer from
   training data.
3. **A procedure with real judgment in it** that would otherwise be improvised
   inconsistently.

Everything else is filler however well written. A 400–850 line `SKILL.md` with
no bundled files is a tutorial, not a tool. 27 such skills (11,788 lines) were
retired on 2026-08-08 for this reason, and the same diet was applied to
`principles/AGENTS.md` (161 → 23 lines) and to weft's `CLAUDE.md`.

This matters mechanically, not just aesthetically: skills are progressive
disclosure — the body loads on invoke, but **every name and description sits in
the discovery surface of every session**, competing for attention.

## 4. Adding a skill

```bash
mkdir -p plugins/<plugin>/skills/<name>
$EDITOR plugins/<plugin>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md   # name + description frontmatter
python3 validate-skills.py
bash scripts/regen-catalog.sh
git commit && git push
```

- A **new plugin** also needs `plugins/<plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and a
  row in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
- Every CLI, Claude Code included, gets the symlink on its next convergence run
  (`wagent sync --local`, or the hourly timer). Nothing is hand-linked. A skill
  meant for some CLIs only says so with a `clis:` line in its frontmatter.
- Anything under `principles/skills/` is deployed to **all** CLIs by
  `bash scripts/deploy-principles.sh`.

## 5. Retiring a skill

Delete it — git holds the history. Do not create a `deprecated/` folder; that
just means auditing the graveyard too. **Before deleting, check §2**: confirm it
is redundant on every CLI, not just the one you happen to be running in.

The periodic maintenance pass is the `skill-audit` skill, which ships the
detection commands (size/bundling inventory, broken internal references,
duplicate-under-a-different-name, and genuine invocation counts). Its companion
`flywheel-audit` decides what to *adopt*. Intake and pruning.

One trap it records: measuring usage by grepping the skill name across
transcripts is wrong — a deleted filler skill scored 52 "uses" from prose
mentions alone. The Skill tool writes `"skill":"<name>"`; match that.

## 6. Things that were broken and are load-bearing now

Do not "clean up" these without understanding them:

- **`scripts/deploy-principles.sh` links into `~/.claude/skills` too.** It used
  not to, on a comment reading "Claude already has them" — which was false, so
  `flywheel-audit` was unreachable from Claude Code while the AGENTS.md loaded
  into every Claude session ended by pointing at it.
- **`validate-skills.py` globs `plugins/*/skills/**/SKILL.md` plus
  `principles/skills/*`.** The old non-recursive glob silently skipped three
  real files.
- **`validate-skills.py` parses the frontmatter with PyYAML, not just regex.**
  The regex checks passed `firefox-control`, whose unquoted `clis-why` contained
  `": "`. Claude Code loaded it anyway; dsh's stricter `yaml@2.9.0` rejected the
  file and dropped the skill, and nothing said so. A frontmatter check that never
  parses YAML cannot see what the strict loaders see.
- **The marketplace is registered against the GitHub remote** by the
  reconciler (`unattachedgray/weft-fabric`), and an installed plugin is a copy
  pinned to a commit under `~/.claude/plugins/cache`. An earlier note here
  claimed a local-path registration with live edits; measured 2026-09-04 on two
  machines, that was not the case. This is why skills reach Claude Code by
  symlink and only hook-bearing plugins are installed from the marketplace.
- **The remote holds history this clone once lost.** The local clone was
  disconnected with a flattened one-commit history; it was grafted back on top
  of `origin/main`. **Never `push --force`** here.

## 7. Open question, deliberately left open

The `principles/AGENTS.md` diet dropped **§6 "Desktop Screenshots Need
Confirmation"** — a security guardrail requiring confirmation before capturing
the desktop, and vetting of any new skill/plugin/MCP that can screenshot, read
the clipboard, capture mic/webcam, decrypt browser cookies, harvest `.env`, or
run autonomously from session-start hooks.

That is precisely the rule that would gate installing a marketplace. It was
removed without a commit message explaining why. Restoring it is the owner's
call — flagged here so it is not lost again silently. An agent should not
decide this one alone.
