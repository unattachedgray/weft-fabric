# Homing missiles and a tactical nuke in Terraria

> Two to four sentences: what you built, in which game, by which route, and whether it runs in the real game
> (and how you know).

## Setup
Game build, store, OS, loader/tool versions, anything installed first. The versions that worked are the most
useful thing you can write down.

## Route and why
Which route (see `route:`), what else you considered, and why you didn't take it.

## How the game works (what we had to learn)
The engine facts you discovered: file formats, key classes/functions/natives, coordinate systems, data layouts,
frame layouts, hard-coded limits. Describe them in your own words and name the symbols; don't paste decompiled
code or game data. Link public docs where they exist.

## Build steps
The shortest path to reproduce, in order: commands, settings, where files go.

## Verification
How you knew it worked: the oracle (in-game test scene, logs, screenshots you looked at, trace replays,
round-trips), and what you did NOT verify.

## Gotchas
The most valuable section. Numbered; each one symptom → cause → fix.
1. **Symptom.** What you saw. **Cause:** what it really was. **Fix:** what worked.

## Assets
How art/audio/3D were made (models, prompts, `um` commands), if any.

## Cost and time
Optional: wall-clock, sessions, API spend.

## Open questions
What's unresolved or would be the next step.
