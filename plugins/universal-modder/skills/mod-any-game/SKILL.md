name: mod-any-game
description: Mod a PC game the user owns, taking an idea to working in the real game and recorded. It covers new items, weapons, enemies, bosses, units, civilizations, mechanics, art, sound, VR and cross-game mashups. Use when the user wants to mod, extend, hack on, reverse engineer or mash up a game ("add a nuke to Terraria", "make a new civ for Age of Empires", "put Minecraft inside X", "can I mod this game?"). It covers recon (engine, loaders, anti-cheat), choosing the route, a safe lab, a first vertical slice, fal-generated assets, in-game verification and a showcase clip.

## Local installation and older-game repair

Before using the general workflow, read [the local integration guide](../../LOCAL-INTEGRATION.md)
for tool routing, compatibility repair and this installation’s optional steps.


# Mod any game

You are the modder. The user names a game and an idea, and you take it all the way to working in the real
game, on video. The method below shipped three projects:
- a Terraria mod (homing missiles, a tactical nuke, new enemies, a boss);
- a new Age of Empires II civilization with 3D-rendered units;
- real Minecraft composited into GTA V.

It also folds in what the September 2026 wave of AI mashup mods (Minecraft in Elden Ring, skateboarding in
MW2) showed about scaling up.
- Case studies: `references/case-studies.md`.
- Code: `examples/`.
- Everything other agents have written down: the knowledge base (`knowledge/` in the repo, `um kb search`).

## Your tools

`um` is the toolkit CLI. Plugin installs and clones put it on PATH (it lives at `bin/um` in the repo).
Otherwise install it once for any agent: `uv tool install git+https://github.com/rehan-remade/universal-modder`
(or `pipx install ...`). Every group has `--help` with examples.

| Need | Command |
|---|---|
| What games are installed, what engine, what anti-cheat, where saves live | `um scan --list`, `um scan "<game>"` |
| Sprites, textures, PBR, 3D models, rigs, SFX, music, voice, video (fal) | `um fal <recipe>`, or the fal MCP (`search_models`, `run_model`) |
| Cut out / fit / pixelate / pack sprites; 3D model → sprite frames | `um sprite ...`, `um render3d ...` |
| Launch, screenshot, click/type, record a Windows game (also from WSL) | `um win ...` |
| Snapshot saves before touching them; undo | `um backup create/diff/restore` |
| Cut a showcase video | `um video contact/compile/mux` |
| Lint a mod before sharing (game files, decompiled code, secrets) | `um publish check` |

## The loop

### 0. Intake (keep it short)
- Get the game, the platform and store, and the idea in one sentence ("a homing missile launcher and a nuke
  that craters the world"). Also agree what done means; usually that's working in game plus a 20-45 s clip.
- Settle online vs offline up front. If the game is online or competitive and has anti-cheat, don't mod the
  client (see Hard rules). Offer offline modes, private servers the user runs, or the official tools
  (Workshop, creative/map editors).
- Start `MODLOG.md` in the working folder as the journal. Record paths, IDs, file formats, class names, what
  failed and why, and the next step. Anything not in the journal is lost at the next context compaction.

### 1. Recon (the game-recon skill does this in depth)
- **Search the knowledge base first.** Run `um kb search "<game>"` and `um kb search "<engine>"`. If
  another agent left a field note, start from its exact versions, route and gotchas, and don't repeat its
  dead ends. Without `um`, read
  https://github.com/rehan-remade/universal-modder/blob/main/knowledge/INDEX.md.
- Run `um scan "<game>"`. It reports the engine and version, whether code is managed or native, anti-cheat,
  mod loaders already installed, save folders, ranked routes, and which playbook in
  `references/engines/` to read. Read that playbook.
- Research the community as it is now: the wiki's modding page, Nexus / Thunderstore / mod.io / Workshop,
  GitHub, and the loader's current release and install steps. Versions move, so don't install from memory.
  If the community already has a loader (tModLoader, SMAPI, BepInEx, UE4SS, REFramework, SKSE, Fabric),
  use it.

### 2. Pick the cheapest route that reaches the idea

| Route | When | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Data / assets only | the idea fits the game's data files | AoE2 `.dat` via genieutils, Bethesda ESP/ESL, Paradox scripts, JSON content packs, pak overrides |
| Loader API | a loader exposes hooks for it | tModLoader `ModItem`/`ModNPC`, SMAPI, BepInEx plugin, UE4SS Lua, REFramework Lua, SKSE plugin |
| Managed-code patching | .NET/Mono/IL2CPP/Java with no API for your idea | Harmony prefix/postfix/transpiler, MonoMod, Mixin |
| Native hooks | C/C++ engine with no loader | proxy DLL (`dinput8`/`version`/`winmm`) + MinHook/SafetyHook, signature scans |
| Reimplement / decomp / recomp | total control, or retro consoles | N64 decomps, N64Recomp, XenonRecomp, IW4L-style rewrites that read the user's own game files |
| Mashup / passthrough | two games at once | the **mashup-mods** skill |

Write the chosen route and the reason into MODLOG.md before building.

### 3. Lab setup (the safety net)
- Before the first modded launch, run `um backup create "<saves folder>" --name <game>-saves` (the paths come
  from `um scan`). Snapshot the config/profile folder too if you'll change settings.
- Use a separate lab profile or save folder when the loader allows it (tModLoader
  `-tmlsavedirectory`, an MO2 profile, a copy of the world or scenario). Scripted takes destroy test worlds,
  so keep a pristine copy and restore it before every take.
- Use windowed mode at a known client size (registry/ini, see game-automation) so screenshots and click
  coordinates stay stable.
- Keep decompiled code and extracted assets outside the repo (e.g. `~/<game>-decomp`) and gitignore any
  derived data. Never commit game files.

### 4. Read the source of truth
Read the actual code and data instead of guessing how the engine behaves. The **reverse-engineering** skill
covers the tools:
- decompile: ILSpy/`ilspycmd`, Cpp2IL, Vineflower, Ghidra/IDA over MCP;
- dump data: genieutils, xEdit, UndertaleModTool, FModel;
- inspect live: UnityExplorer, the UE4SS live viewer, REFramework, Cheat Engine.

Record exact names and IDs in MODLOG.md. Check what the executable enforces as well as what the data says.
In AoE2 the data happily holds a 64th civilization, but the civ picker only lists civs from a table
hard-coded in the exe, so the mod replaces a slot instead of adding one.

### 5. Vertical slice first
Take one item, unit or weapon all the way through with placeholder art. Define it, launch, and prove it
appears and works, from the log plus a screenshot you actually look at. Only then widen. Commit each working
step in the mod's own git repo.

### 6. Assets (fal-assets and asset-pipeline skills)
Study the game's own assets first: size, palette, outline, camera angle, facing, frame layout. Then generate
with `um fal`. Every call is recorded in `fal_manifest.jsonl`. Convert with `um sprite` / `um render3d` into
exactly what the engine loads.
- **Consistency across many angles and frames:** generate one concept, turn it into 3D
  (`um fal model3d`), then render every heading from the game's camera (`um render3d --preset aoe2`).
- **Pixel-art games:** generate on a flat background or with transparency, cut out, then do one
  nearest-neighbour fit to the frame size.

### 7. Verify in the real game (build an oracle)
The running game is the oracle; your reading of the code is not.
- Make the test repeatable: a mod-side chat command or timeline, a scenario with triggers, or a test world.
  Drive the launch → menus → scene path with `um win launch/drive`, and check it with `um win shot` plus the
  game's log files.
- Read screenshots at reduced scale (`--scale 0.33`) to save tokens; multiply coordinates back when clicking.
- **Circuit breaker:** if the same failure repeats 3 times, stop. Write down what you know, then change
  approach or ask the user.
- Common log locations:

| Game / loader | Log |
|---|---|
| tModLoader | `client.log` |
| BepInEx | `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` |
| UE4SS | `UE4SS.log` |
| Unity | `Player.log` in `AppData/LocalLow/<company>/<product>/` |
| SKSE | `Documents/My Games/<game>/SKSE/` |
| Minecraft | `logs/latest.log` |

### 8. Showcase (the showcase-video skill)
Script the take so it's repeatable. Record the game window with the game's own audio (`um win record`).
Choose moments from a contact sheet, then cut 20-45 s with one-line titles and a fade-out
(`um video compile`).

### 9. Package and publish (the publish-mod skill)
Run `um publish check <mod> --game "<install>"`. Write a README with install steps. Credit tools, loaders and
fal-generated assets, and be honest that it was built with AI. Ship no game files.

### 10. Leave a field note (the share-field-notes skill)
Turn `MODLOG.md` into a knowledge-base note (`um kb new ...`, then `um kb check`). Cover:
- exact versions;
- the route;
- what the engine really does;
- how you verified it;
- numbered gotchas.

With your human's OK, open a PR (`um kb pr <note> --yes`). Do this even if the mod isn't finished: a
documented dead end saves the next agent hours.

## Hard rules
- **Ownership.** Only mod games the user owns.
- **Online play.** Stay in single-player/offline, or on servers the user controls. Never touch the client of
  an online game protected by anti-cheat (EasyAntiCheat, BattlEye, Vanguard, VAC on official servers,
  Ricochet, ACE). Never write cheats (aimbots, ESP, speedhacks) for multiplayer.
- **No bypasses.** Never bypass anti-cheat, DRM or ownership checks. tModLoader refuses to start unless the
  free tModLoader app is in the user's Steam library: add it, don't patch the check. If a game needs its
  anti-cheat off for mods, use only the official offline launch option.
- **No redistribution.** Don't ship game files, decompiled source or extracted assets. Ship your own code and
  assets, or patches and converters that run on the user's own install ("bring your own game files").
- **Back up first.** Run `um backup` before changing saves, profiles or game folders. Keep the restore path
  written in MODLOG.md.
- **Process hygiene.**
  - Kill by exact PID (`um win kill <pid>`). Never use `pkill -f` (it matches your own shell) or wildcard
    kills.
  - Never block the game's main thread (for example by waiting on ffmpeg from inside a mod).
  - Clear crash reporters (BugSplat etc.) by PID when Steam refuses to relaunch.
- **The user's machine.**
  - Driving input takes over their mouse and keyboard. Check `um win drive --proc X idle` and ask before long
    automated sessions while they're at the PC.
  - Ask before installing a loader into the game folder, changing registry or graphics settings, deleting
    anything, or publishing.
