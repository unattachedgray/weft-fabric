description: Figure out how a specific installed game can be modded, before writing any mod code. Covers where it's installed, the engine and version, managed vs native code, anti-cheat, loaders already present, save and config folders, and the community's modding route. Use when the user asks "can I mod <game>?", "what engine is <game>", "how do people mod <game>", or at the start of any modding task. Produces MODDING_PLAN.md.

# Game recon

Goal: in about five minutes, know what you're dealing with and which route to take. Write the answer down
so every later step can rely on it.

## 0. Has another agent been here?
`um kb search "<game>"` (and the engine name). A field note in the shared knowledge base can hand you the
working versions, the route, and the gotchas before you touch anything. See the **share-field-notes** skill.

## 1. Find it and fingerprint it
```bash
um scan --list                 # Steam, Epic and Xbox installs (Windows, WSL, Linux, macOS)
um scan "<name or folder>"     # engine, version, exes (.NET?), anti-cheat, loaders, mod folders, saves, routes
um scan "<game>" --json        # the same, machine-readable
```
`um` lives at `bin/um` in the universal-modder repo (plugins and clones put it on PATH). Anywhere else:
`uv tool install git+https://github.com/rehan-remade/universal-modder`.

`um scan` reads files only. It indexes the install (bounded), sniffs PE headers, the Unity/Godot/GameMaker
headers and the Unreal version string, maps known games to their community loader, and points to the
playbook to read: `skills/mod-any-game/references/engines/<engine>.md`.

The scan can't see everything, so check these by hand:
- **Game not in a store library** (GOG, itch, a standalone folder): pass the folder path.
- **Several engines' signals:** launchers and web helpers are common. The top score wins, but read the
  "also" line.
- **Anti-cheat installed elsewhere:** kernel drivers (Vanguard's `vgk.sys`) and launcher-level protection
  don't live in the game folder. Search "<game> anti-cheat".
- **Online-only or live-service games:** treat them as protected even if nothing was detected.

## 2. Research the living community (always; versions move)
Search, in order:
1. "<game> modding" / "<game> mod loader" / "<game> modding wiki". The game's wiki often has a modding page.
2. Nexus Mods (most popular mods show which frameworks they depend on), Thunderstore (Unity games: BepInEx
   packs), mod.io, the Steam Workshop (does the game have one? `um scan` shows installed Workshop content).
3. GitHub: "<game> mod", "<game> modding api", "<game> decompile", "<game> sdk", "<engine> mod loader".
4. Recent posts (X/Reddit/Discord announcements) for new frameworks. The loader might be days old.

Capture: the loader's name, repo, **current version and install steps**, the game versions it supports, a
"hello world" example mod, and where logs go.

## 3. Decide
- **Can it be modded safely?** Look at anti-cheat, online-only parts, the EULA or mod policy, and the
  ownership checks that loaders rely on (see `skills/mod-any-game/references/safety.md`). If not: say so,
  and offer what is possible (official tools, offline modes, a different game with the same idea).
- **Route:** loader API > data/asset mod > managed patching > native hooks > reimplementation/mashup. Pick
  the first that reaches the user's idea.

## 4. Write MODDING_PLAN.md
```markdown
# <Game> modding plan
- Install: <path> (<store> <appid>), version <x>
- Engine: <engine + version>, code: managed .NET / IL2CPP / native, 64-bit
- Anti-cheat / online: <none | what + verdict>
- Saves: <path>   Config: <path>   Logs: <path>
- Community route: <loader vX.Y (repo)>, install: <steps>, example mod: <link>
- Chosen route for "<idea>": <route> because <reason>
- Lab plan: backup <folders> (um backup), lab profile <how>, windowed <how>
- Unknowns to resolve first: <list>
```
Then continue with the mod-any-game loop (lab setup → source of truth → vertical slice).
