recompile-and-diff, a second class recovery, a compiled header — or you are emitting a
layout that a 64-bit host will silently relay.

## The external oracle — the only check that is not the program grading itself

Everything in the loop is internal: the program adjudicating claims about itself. Independent
witness kinds help, invariants help, poisons help — but they are all computed from the same
database by the same agent, and a systematically wrong assumption survives all of them. Four
routes step outside that, ordered by how directly they falsify a layout claim.

**1. Recompile and diff — the decision procedure.** Compile a candidate function with a
period-correct toolchain and diff its object code against the original bytes. This is not an
opinion, and a struct is validated *as a side effect*: a wrong field offset moves a
displacement and the diff shows it. Adopt the annotation convention early even if a full
match is never the goal — address-tagged source (`// FUNCTION: <module> 0x…`) turns an
unbuildable reimplementation into a growing set of falsifiable claims.

The mature toolchain for this on **32-bit x86 MSVC** is `isledecomp/reccmp`
(<https://github.com/isledecomp/reccmp>), built for exactly that profile, with siblings that
check the things this skill otherwise verifies only against itself: **`vtable`** (virtual
table correctness), **`datacmp`** (globals), **`stackcmp`** (stack layout). `isledecomp/isle`
is a fully decompiled MSVC 4.20 game and an honest calibration of what "matching" achieves
(functionally identical, mostly instruction-matching, *not* byte-for-byte).
**`encounter/objdiff`** is the x86-capable interactive differ. **Do not reach for the famous
N64-lineage tools** — `m2c`, `decomp-permuter` and `asm-differ` are MIPS/PPC/ARM/SH and do
not apply to x86; recommending them here is a category error.

**2. A second, independent class recovery.** Ghidra ships one —
`RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript` plus the `classrecovery` package (hierarchy, ctor/dtor
identification, vftable ordering, class structures filled from decompiler p-code store
information, with `ApplyClassFunctionSignatureUpdatesScript` to propagate a signature edit
through the vftable definitions). It **hard-gates on RTTI**, so on a `/GR-` binary it does
nothing — *and that is the citable justification for hand-rolling, which you should state
rather than leave implicit.* Where RTTI is absent, **CMU SEI Pharos `OOAnalyzer`** targets
"32-bit x86 executables compiled by Microsoft Visual C++" with an explicit `--ignore-rtti`,
emitting members and offsets, method↔class assignment, inheritance, ctors/dtors and
vftables; import it through **CERT Kaiju**. Read its published accuracy before believing it:
constructors ≈0.88 F1 and vftables ≈0.97, but **destructors 0.41 F1 (precision 0.32)** and
**no published accuracy for member offsets at all**. Import as *candidates*, never as
decided — and know that identical-code folding merges classes, so an ICF-heavy binary
degrades it further.

**3. A similarity witness that states its own error rate.** See the BSim VT correlator under
"Separating library code from game code" (`references/game-recon.md`): corpus-free, and it
publishes a false-positive model. Nothing else here does.

**4. `ProgramDiff` against a checkpoint version** — the change-set measurement under
"Mutation safety — the rest of the bracket" (`references/applying-changes.md`). Not an
external *source*, but it is the program's own record of what you did rather than your
memory of it.

**AND IF YOU HAVE ONE, WIRE IT TO SOMETHING THAT RUNS IT — AN UNWIRED ORACLE ROTS SILENTLY AND
NOTHING ELSE CAN NOTICE.** Measured, and it is the worst-placed instance of this document's "a
harness is blind to what it does not run" rule: a project that emits its recovered layouts as C
with `offsetof` assertions and compiles them — the recommendation under "Emit a C header"
in `references/applying-changes.md` — had that header
**failing to compile for 90 commits** and three program versions, 161 errors. It was found only
because an unrelated side project ran the generator for a baseline. The cause is worth carrying
on its own:

- **A TARGET POINTER IS 4 BYTES AND THE HOST'S IS NOT.** A round correctly retyped a field to
  `char *`, and the evidence artifact recorded it correctly — `ctype "char *"`, **`width 4`**,
  right for a 32-bit target. The generator emitted the *spelling* verbatim and ignored the
  *width*, so on any x86-64 host the member became 8 bytes and 8-ALIGNED, the containing struct
  went 268 → 280, and all five classes embedding it shifted. **When an artifact records both a
  spelling and a width, the width is the fact.** Emit fixed-width types (`uint32_t` for a 32-bit
  target pointer, real type in a comment) and the header stays host-independent.
- **HOST-INDEPENDENCE IS WHAT MAKES THE CHECK RUNNABLE, NOT A STYLE PREFERENCE.** The obvious
  alternative — `-m32` — failed twice on that machine: at link (`Scrt1.o` absent) and even under
  `-fsyntax-only` (`bits/libc-header-start.h`), for want of multilib. **A check that needs a
  toolchain you do not have is a check that will not be run**, which is how it came to rot.
- **The sibling generator had already made the right decision and documented it.** Two emitters,
  one convention, one follower — the copy-instead-of-move divergence "A rule built for one
  population must be offered to its SIBLING populations" (`references/harvesting-traps.md`)
  warns about, between two files nobody thought of as sharing a rule.

**Why this is a standing instruction:** a methodology built around never corroborating your
own guesses should want, more than anything, one check it cannot influence. If none of these
is reachable, say so explicitly in the round's record — "no external oracle available" is a
finding about the project's confidence ceiling, not an absence worth passing over in silence.

## Target ABI vs host ABI — the width that breaks three things

Nearly every target this document is about is 32-bit, and nearly every machine you will build on
is 64-bit. Under LP64 a pointer is **8 bytes and 8-ALIGNED** where the target's is 4, and `long`
is 8 where the target's is 4. Write `char *` or `long` into a recovered struct and the compiler
silently relays every field after it and changes `sizeof`.

The same mistake surfaces in three places, in increasing order of cost and decreasing order of
noise — which is exactly the wrong order for finding it.

**1. In the HEADER it is loud, and that is the cheap case.** Measured: one field retyped from
`uint` to `char *` — correctly; the evidence artifact recorded `ctype "char *"` with **`width
4`** — was emitted with its *spelling* rather than its *width*. `sizeof` of the containing record
went **268 → 280**, the five classes embedding it all shifted, and the header produced **161
errors for 90 commits** because nothing was wired to run the compile. **When an artifact records
both a spelling and a width, the width is the fact.** Emit `uint32_t` for a 32-bit target pointer
and name the real type in a comment. The header then compiles anywhere, which is the difference
between a check that runs and a check that rots.

**CORRECTION, measured on the same project a year later: "compiles anywhere" is the defect, not the
virtue.** A header that spells every pointer `uint32_t` compiles IDENTICALLY on a 32- and a 64-bit
host, so it contains nothing that could be the wrong width, and **no pointer-width error is
detectable by construction**. The compile check had been described as the one step that recomputes
every offset from the C object model, and it passed for months while verifying a proxy. It also
discarded decided evidence at the last step: 75 pointer cells, 32 with a named pointee, reached the
header as bare integers with the pointee recorded nowhere. The fix was to compile for the TARGET
(`-m32` with the multilib installed) and emit the real pointers, spelled `struct X *` against
forward-declared tags. After the change all three headers compiled under `-m32` and FAILED on the
host, with 5, 627 and 138 errors: the check could now tell the two apart. Two rules generalise:

- **Ask of any check what input would make it fail. If the answer does not include the property it
  exists to verify, it is a proxy**, and a passing proxy looks exactly like a passing check.
- **Make the target-width check refuse rather than fall back.** Compile a probe asserting
  `sizeof(void *) == 4` first, and on failure name the missing packages and say not to drop `-m32`.
  Without it, a machine lacking multilib fails inside `<stdint.h>` with an error about glibc, whose
  obvious "fix" is to drop the flag and silently return to the 64-bit proxy. Asserting the PROPERTY
  also catches a toolchain that accepts `-m32` and ignores it.

The width-over-spelling rule above still holds for the ARTIFACT (record the width; it is the fact).
What changed is the emitted C: once the target can be compiled for, a 4-byte pointer is emitted as a
pointer and checked as one.

**2. In a RECOMPILE-AND-DIFF it is quiet, and it invalidates the comparison.** Every displacement
in the emitted object code is computed from the host's layout, so a struct the host resized
produces instruction-level differences that are artifacts of your build rather than of your
reimplementation — and you will chase them as if they were findings. Build 32-bit for this work
(`-m32` plus the multilib, or a cross-toolchain), and establish that you *can* before planning
around it: on one machine `-m32` failed at link for `Scrt1.o` and even under `-fsyntax-only` for
`bits/libc-header-start.h`.

**3. In a SOURCE-LEVEL REIMPLEMENTATION it is quiet and load-bearing**, because the properties
such projects are graded by are precisely the byte-layout-sensitive ones: a save format, a replay,
a network packet, a **lockstep sync checksum**. A reimplementation built 64-bit reproduces the
*behaviour* of every struct containing a pointer and none of its *layout* — so it desyncs against
the original binary and cannot load its own saves, for a reason that never appears anywhere in the
logic and survives every unit test you would think to write. **If the destination is functional
equivalence graded by those oracles, the pointer width is part of the specification.** Model
target pointers as explicit 32-bit handles or offsets, or commit to building 32-bit — and write
down which, because the decision is invisible in the source once made.

**A WIDER SCALAR SMUGGLES IN AN ALIGNMENT THE SAME WAY A POINTER SMUGGLES IN A SIZE.** The
pointer case above is the famous half; this is the one that will bite you when you emit *gaps*.
Measured, on the very first run of a generator written with the pointer lesson already in hand:
the obvious width→type map `{1: uint8_t, 2: uint16_t, 4: uint32_t, 8: uint64_t}` put a `uint64_t`
on an 8-byte **gap** at offset `0x1dc`. That offset is 4-aligned and not 8-aligned, so the
compiler padded to `0x1e0` and relayed every later field in the class. **An 8-byte gap is not a
64-bit integer — it is eight bytes nothing observes**, and the recovered evidence claimed a width,
never an alignment. Emit gaps and any width you did not independently establish as a scalar as
`uint8_t[N]`, which aligns to 1 and can therefore sit at whatever offset the evidence records.
The general form: **every type name is a claim, and a layout emitter must only make the claims its
evidence actually supports.**

Two things worth taking from how that surfaced:

- **The external evaluator grades your PIPELINE, not only your data.** That round had honestly
  priced itself as "assurance, not a findings engine" — 3753 of 3796 fields were naturally
  placeable and no class had non-abutting regions, so nothing was expected to fire. The first
  compile rejected the *emitter*. Build the oracle even when you expect the data to be clean.
- **Ask the compiler WHERE it diverged; do not read the declarations and reason.** The failing
  assertions named offsets from `0x1f4` onward and the declarations there looked perfectly
  consecutive and 4-aligned. A probe that walks the members in order and reports the FIRST
  mismatch named the real culprit 24 bytes earlier, immediately.

**The general rule, and it is not only about pointers:** a recovered layout is a statement about
the TARGET's ABI. Anything whose size or alignment differs between target and host — pointers,
`long`, `size_t`, `ptrdiff_t`, enum width, `double` alignment, bitfield packing order, struct tail
padding — must be pinned explicitly rather than inherited from whatever compiler happens to build
your source. Ghidra will tell you what the target thinks: the `data_organization` block in the
compiler spec (`x86win.cspec` for 32-bit MSVC) records `pointer_size`, `long_long_size`,
`double_size`, the size→alignment map and `bitfield_packing use_MS_convention`. That is the
authority; your build host is not.

Endianness and fixed-point are the same family of problem on non-x86 targets and are covered in
`references/platforms-eras.md`.

## The format's own integrity checks ARE the oracle — find them first

An external oracle is the only check that is not the program grading itself, and the usual ones are
expensive: a shipped file to round-trip, a companion tool, a second implementation. Before reaching
for any of those, **look for the checks the format performs on ITSELF.** A serialised format written
by a careful team usually validates as it reads, and those validations encode the invariants the
authors considered load-bearing — which is exactly what a reimplementation must preserve.

**Measured**, on a 1999 game's save format. The loader guards every object record three ways:

- a leading sequence number that must equal a running counter,
- a trailing sequence number that must equal it again,
- and, after populating the object, **`ftell() != recorded_end_offset -> bail`**.

That third check asserts the single most useful invariant available: **the reader consumed exactly
the bytes the writer produced.** And it runs **once per OBJECT**, so a failure localises to one
class rather than to the file — a far sharper instrument than "does the save load".

- **Grep the bail/assert/panic strings early.** Five strings fenced this entire format
  (`"Savegame File Invalid!"`, `"Corrupted loadgame file"` at three sites, `"Undefined object type
  during load game"`, `"Expected object non-existant during loadgame"`, `"Cannot save a non-handlized
  object!"`), and each one names an invariant for free. In a release build with asserts compiled
  out, these survive because they are error paths, not asserts.
- **Prefer a per-record check to a whole-file one** when grading a reimplementation. Pass/fail on a
  file tells you something is wrong; a per-object bound tells you which class.
- **A length or end-offset field is the check.** Any format that records where a record ends is
  telling you it intends to verify that, or to skip — either way it hands you a boundary you can
  assert against.

## The binary's own instrumentation is an oracle — switch it back on

The section above is about the checks a format performs on itself. This is the same move one level
out: **the release build ships diagnostic instrumentation with the sink removed or muted, and you can
restore the sink on a patched COPY.** Those call sites are normally mined for the *strings* they pass
(`references/game-recon.md`, round zero). That is the weaker use. The stronger one is to let the
original binary emit a runtime trace you can diff a reimplementation against.

*Source: this section generalises the approach taken by the third-party project
`gmegidish/crux-re-claude` (a Win95 adventure engine, `tools/patch_trace.py` + `tools/tracediff.py`).
Its counts below are its write-up's, read but not re-measured here.*

Two shapes to look for:

- **A compiled-out stub.** Their release build reduced `Debug_Trace(line, srcFile, fmt, ...)` to a
  body that moves each argument onto itself and returns. **177 call sites still push their
  arguments** and nothing consumes them; no flag re-enables it, because the body is gone and only
  the calls survive.
- **A live sink writing where nothing collects it.** A per-object status-string setter, or a global
  `char *` breadcrumb assigned a literal at checkpoints for a crash handler to print. This one runs
  in retail on every frame — the data is produced and discarded.

**The mechanism, and why it is cheaper than it sounds: patch a copy, and call the binary's own
statically linked CRT.** An era-typical MSVC game already contains `vsprintf`, `fopen`, `fprintf`
and `fclose` at fixed addresses — your library partition (`references/game-recon.md`) already names
them. Assemble a small body into a code cave (the `int3` or zero run between sections) that formats
the varargs and appends to a file, then point the stub at it. No new import, no new section, no
relocation, no loader change.

Two disciplines separate a tool from a foot-gun:

- **Refuse to patch unless the target bytes still match exactly.** Their script hard-compares the
  expected no-op stub and exits rather than patch a build it does not recognise. A trace harness
  applied silently to the wrong build produces a plausible log, which is worse than no log.
- **Never write the original.** Emit a `_DEBUG` copy and leave the analysed file byte-identical, or
  the artifact every other oracle is calibrated against has moved underneath them.

**Why this is worth more than its size: it is the only oracle in this file that grades ORDER.**
Every other one here is static — a header's `_Static_assert`ed offsets, a recompile-and-diff, a save
round-trip — and grades *structure*. A trace grades the sequence a state machine actually walks:
which phase, for which object, in what order, on which frame. Where the destination is functional
equivalence, that is exactly the class of defect the layout oracles cannot see, and it localises to a
call site rather than to a subsystem.

**Diff on a reduced event vocabulary, not on text.** Their differ maps each side — engine log and
reimplementation log, written independently and worded differently — through its own regex table into
a shared alphabet of event kinds, then aligns the two sequences (`difflib.SequenceMatcher`). That
reduction is what turns two logs into "you diverge HERE". Diffing raw lines cannot work; the two
implementations have no reason to phrase anything alike.

**Keep a NAMED list of permanent divergences.** They carry one — the engine loads cursors and area
backdrops as animation slots where the port has separate paths — because a differential oracle with
known-benign noise in it stops being read, and an oracle nobody reads is precisely the rot the
standing instruction at the top of this file is about.

**Record it at the runtime tier.** A trace is a fact about one execution, one build and one
configuration — the same provenance caveat as any runtime observation, never `IMPORTED`. And be
clear about what it grades: your reimplementation, not the binary.

## An in-binary check can corroborate a TOOLING conclusion by an unrelated route

When your instruments say a thing about the binary, the program's own assertions may say the same
thing independently — and that pairing is worth much more than either alone, because the two routes
share no failure modes.

**Measured.** A probe comparison had flagged 19 classes whose serializer and deserializer appeared
to touch different fields. Reading the bodies concluded they were all artefacts of the probe. The
loader's own `ftell() != end_offset` check then said the same thing from inside the program: a
genuine field-written-never-read would make the game unable to load its own save, so the disagreement
could not have been real. Neither route was cheap to doubt afterwards.

Look for this deliberately: after concluding "our tool was wrong, not the binary", ask **what the
binary would have to do at runtime if we were wrong** — and whether it checks for it.

## A back-patched length field tells you the reader's shape

`write placeholder -> write payload -> seek back -> write the real position -> seek forward` is a
distinctive idiom, and it is not just bookkeeping. A format that records where each record ends was
designed for a reader that can **skip a record it does not understand.**

Seeing it, predict the rest before reading it: a dispatch loop keyed on a type tag, a registry
mapping tag to constructor, and at least one pass in which the payload is **not** read at all.
Measured here: all three were present, and the loader turned out to be **two-pass** — construct
every object from its header while seeking past every payload, then rewind and populate. That second
structure follows from objects referencing each other by handle, and it is worth checking for
whenever a format stores cross-references.

## Read BOTH sides of a symmetric pair — the reader carries the semantics

When a format has a writer and a reader, analysing the writer feels sufficient: it enumerates the
fields in order, which is what a layout question asks for. **Read the reader anyway, even when the
open item does not ask for it.**

A serializer tells you the LAYOUT. A deserializer tells you the SEMANTICS, because it has to decide
what to DO with each value — and that forces it to reveal structure the writer can leave implicit.

**Measured.** One round read a save format's writer and stopped. Reading the matching loader
afterwards yielded three things the writer could not have shown:

- the section markers were not merely written but **fully validated**, both fields, each with its
  own bail — a second oracle the writer-side read had classified as bookkeeping;
- the file stored a level NAME and the loader **called the mission loader** before applying any
  state, which made the whole file a DELTA over a shipped data file rather than a self-contained
  world;
- both unnamed writer helpers were **paired** with reader counterparts, naming them by symmetry.

## Check for validation at EVERY granularity, not just the one you found

Finding one integrity check is not finishing the search. Formats written by careful teams guard at
several scales at once, and each scale localises failure differently.

**Measured**, on one save format: a per-OBJECT check (`ftell() != recorded_end_offset`) found in one
round, and a per-SECTION check (an incrementing tag AND the section's own recorded offset, both
compared, both bailing) found in the next — plus a whole-file magic and an end sentinel. Four scales.

For grading a reimplementation, prefer the FINEST-grained guard available: a per-file check says
something is wrong, a per-section check says where, a per-object check says which class.

## An unexplained constant array is usually allocator or index state — read its MERGE RULE first

When a format writes a small fixed-size block of integers that no field list explains, do not start
by decoding the values. **Start with how the reader combines them with what is already in memory**,
because the combine operation names the purpose almost by itself.

**Measured.** Nine ints, written near the head of the file, and on load merged with
`existing[i] = max(existing[i], loaded[i])` rather than overwritten. `max` on a next-free cursor
means exactly one thing: *never re-issue an identifier that is already in use somewhere in this
file.* That identified the block as the object-handle allocator's per-bucket cursor before a single
value was examined — and, with a flag that makes each constructed object adopt its saved handle, it
completed the format's identity-preservation mechanism.

Overwrite means "the file is authoritative". `max`/`min` means "a cursor that must not go backwards".
Accumulate means "a running total". Ask what the merge protects against.

## The C compiler is the only instrument in the loop that models ALIGNMENT

Emitting recovered layouts as a header full of `_Static_assert`ed offsets is described above as a
completeness check. It is also the *only* thing here with an opinion about alignment, and that turns
out to be a distinct class of defect from a wrong size.

Measured: a round introduced a new ctype spelling — an array of target pointers, `void*[2]` — into a
layout artifact. The header generator's emission rules did not match it, and it fell through to a
width-only fallback that maps an 8-byte cell to `uint64_t`. **`uint64_t` is 8-byte-aligned on a
64-bit host.** The member sat at an offset that is only 4-aligned, so the host compiler inserted
four bytes of its own and every offset assertion in that class from there on failed.

**The recorded width was correct and the emitted layout was still wrong.** Nothing else could have
noticed: the tiling check verifies the layout against its own arithmetic, and the artifact-level
re-checks compare the artifact to itself. Only the C object model reasons about where a type is
*allowed* to start.

Two rules follow:

- **The fallback is the dangerous branch**, not the missing rule. An unmatched ctype does not fail
  loudly — it gets *guessed*, into something with the right size and the wrong alignment. Prefer a
  fallback that raises on an unrecognised spelling to one that guesses from width.
- **When you add a ctype spelling to a producing sweep, add its emission rule in the same change.**
  The two live in different files and nothing links them; the compile is what connects them, and it
  connects them only after the artifact has already been written.

This is the same target-vs-host hazard as pointer width, one level subtler: fixing the *width* of
every emitted type does not fix its *alignment*, and a pointer array is exactly where the two come
apart.
