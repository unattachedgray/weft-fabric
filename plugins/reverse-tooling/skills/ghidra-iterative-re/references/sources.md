# Sources, and version-sensitivity

**External oracles and second opinions** (added after an expert review of this document,
2026-08-15; the review verified most API claims against a 12.1.2 install, and the web
sources below are cited at the tier the review gave them):

- [isledecomp/reccmp](https://github.com/isledecomp/reccmp) + [isle](https://github.com/isledecomp/isle) — matching decompilation for **32-bit x86 MSVC**, with `vtable`/`datacmp`/`stackcmp`. The closest existing methodology to this skill.
- [encounter/objdiff](https://github.com/encounter/objdiff) — x86-capable interactive object differ. (`m2c`, `decomp-permuter`, `asm-differ` are **not** x86.)
- [CMU SEI Pharos / OOAnalyzer](https://github.com/cmu-sei/pharos) · [CCS'18 paper](https://edmcman.github.io/papers/ccs18.pdf) · [CERT Kaiju](https://github.com/cmu-sei/kaiju) — C++ class recovery for MSVC x86 **without RTTI**.
- [NCC Group — EarlyRemoval in the Conservatory with the Wrench](https://www.nccgroup.com/research/earlyremoval-in-the-conservatory-with-the-wrench-exploring-ghidra-s-decompiler-internals-to-make-automatic-p-code-analysis-scripts/) — why a p-code harvester must declare its simplification style.
- [Votipka et al., *An Observational Investigation of Reverse Engineers' Processes*, USENIX Security 2020](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20-votipka-observational.pdf) — expert REs work hypothesis-first and lean on **control-flow beacons** over name/string beacons.
- [Ghidra VT workflow help](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/master/Ghidra/Features/VersionTracking/src/main/help/help/topics/VersionTrackingPlugin/VT_Workflow.html) — NSA's own certainty ladder (Symbol Name → Exact Data → Exact Function Bytes → Exact Instructions → Exact Mnemonics → Duplicate Function → reference correlators, which consume already-*accepted* matches). Two warnings worth obeying: *scores are not comparable between correlators*, and *do not modify either program while version tracking*.
- [Skochinsky, *Reversing MSVC Part II: Classes, Methods and RTTI*](https://www.openrce.org/articles/full_view/23) — the canonical MSVC object-layout reference.
- [BinDiff](https://github.com/google/bindiff) + [BinExport](https://github.com/google/binexport) — structural, call-graph-propagating matching that survives changes VT's exact correlators reject. (The tagged BinExport Ghidra extension targets 11.0.3; expect to rebuild for 12.x.)
- [REBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.27319) · [REFORGE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.07738) · [OSPREY](https://yonghwi-kwon.github.io/data/osprey_sp21.pdf) — measured ceilings for LLM-assisted RE and Ghidra's own type-recovery baselines.
- [ReVa](https://github.com/cyberkaida/reverse-engineering-assistant) — Ghidra-12-native agent tooling shipped as skills; direct prior art.

**Version-sensitivity.** API claims here were checked against **12.1.2** and several are
version-bound: source-map APIs are 11.3+, `SourceType.AI` is recent, PyGhidra became the
default in 12.0 (with 3.0 deprecations), `SymbolicPropogator`'s recording default changed in
**11.4.1** (`docs/ChangeHistory.md:678` — this document said 12.0 for several revisions), and
`AddVfunctionCallRefScript` is 12.1. **Re-verify against your install before
relying on any of them** — the same discipline as stamping evidence rows with a program
version, applied to the tool.

**The project these notes came from moved to Ghidra 12.3-DEV** (master `d6192cb3f900`, 2026-09-22),
to get a decompiler fix no release carried (GP-7167; see `applying-changes.md`, "A correct float
return on a typed slot"). Claims marked as measured on 12.1.2 were NOT re-verified on 12.3. One API
break met in practice: `DataTypeManager.remove(DataType, TaskMonitor)` is gone on 12.3, and only
`remove(DataType)` remains. What the move itself taught: rehearse a Ghidra upgrade on a copy of the
VERSIONED project, not on an imported snapshot, because anything that opens historical versions
read-only is exactly what a format change can break, and an unversioned copy has no history to
test. On that project all historical versions opened and a ledger derived from them came back
identical.
