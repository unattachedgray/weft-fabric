# Ghidra API reference for iterative RE

Verified against a **Ghidra 12.1.2** install by reading
`docs/ghidra_stubs/pypredef/` and `docs/GhidraAPI_javadoc.zip`. Signatures are
paraphrased for PyGhidra (CPython 3 via JPype). Anything marked *(doc)* is cited from
Ghidra's own documentation but not executed here.

## How to discover API — do this instead of recalling it

A Ghidra install carries a complete, exact-version API surface offline:

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `docs/ghidra_stubs/pypredef/` | **777 package stub files.** Greppable, one per package, includes classes the public javadoc omits (e.g. `AutoAnalysisManager`). Best discovery tool. |
| `docs/ghidra_stubs/typestubs/`, `ghidra_stubs-*.whl` | Same content as installable type stubs |
| `docs/GhidraAPI_javadoc.zip` | Full javadoc (51 MB) — has the prose descriptions the stubs lack |
| `docs/GhidraClass/Advanced/improvingDisassemblyAndDecompilation.pdf` | Authoritative guide to improving decompilation |
| `docs/GhidraClass/{Beginner,Intermediate,AdvancedDevelopment,BSim,Debugger}/` | Course material; `Debugger/B2-Emulation`, `Debugger/B3-Scripting` are substantial |
| `support/analyzeHeadlessREADME.md` | Headless automation reference |
| `docs/CheatSheet.html`, `docs/ChangeHistory.md`, `docs/WhatsNew.md` | UI actions, version deltas |
| `docs/README_PDB.html` | PDB parser — read this **first** on any Windows target, before assuming symbols are gone |
| `docs/languages/` | Processor/Sleigh docs |
| **`Ghidra/*/*/lib/*-src.zip`** | **The Java SOURCE, per module.** Not one archive — one zip beside each jar. This is the only place that answers *"which arm of this call mutates"*, which neither the stubs nor the javadoc state. |

Search these with Python, not shell text tools, if your environment proxies `grep`.

**Read the source, not just the stubs, before depending on a shipped helper.** Measured: three
questions this reference now answers — which `FillOutStructureHelper` argument mutates, why a
shipped byte pattern never fires, and what `checkAfterName` accepts — were **unanswerable from the
javadoc** and took one read each from the source zips. Finding the right zip:

```bash
find "$GHIDRA" -name '*-src.zip' -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' z; do
  unzip -l "$z" 2>/dev/null | grep -q 'TheClass.java' && echo "$z"
done
```

Note the `-print0`/`read -d ''`: under **zsh** an unquoted `$(find ...)` in a `for` loop does
**not** word-split, so the naive form silently hands every path to one `unzip` and reports
nothing. An empty search result is a claim about your search until the search is shown to work.
Useful locations, verified on 12.1.2 — the module a class lives in is rarely the one you guess:

| Class | Module |
|---|---|
| `ghidra.util.bytesearch.*` | `Ghidra/Features/Base/lib/Base-src.zip` |
| `ghidra.app.analyzers.FunctionStartAnalyzer`, `Patterns` | `Ghidra/Features/**BytePatterns**/lib/BytePatterns-src.zip` |
| `ghidra.app.decompiler.util.FillOutStructureHelper` | `Ghidra/Features/Decompiler/lib/Decompiler-src.zip` |
| `ghidra.program.model.data.NoisyStructureBuilder` | `Ghidra/Framework/SoftwareModeling/lib/SoftwareModeling-src.zip` |

## The MCP boundary — what needs a script

An MCP server gives you interactive **reads** cheaply and is the wrong instrument for everything
below. Reach for a script when you need any of these; none is reachable through a read-only tool
surface, and several are actively unsafe through a mutating one.

| Need | Why MCP cannot | See |
|---|---|---|
| Set `SourceType` on anything | Mutating MCP tools hardcode `USER_DEFINED` — audited, 18 occurrences | SKILL.md, "Mutate through scripts" |
| Any bracketed mutation | The invariant diff has to wrap the operation in one transaction | SKILL.md, "Mutation safety" |
| Bulk p-code / SSA work | Per-item calls; you want `ParallelDecompiler` or one `DecompInterface` | "Decompiler" below |
| Drive a shipped analyzer's machinery yourself | No tool exposes `PatternFactory`, `MatchAction`, `PseudoDisassembler` | "Byte pattern search", "Read-only witnesses" |
| Read raw instruction p-code | `Instruction.getPcode()` is the SLEIGH spec; no MCP equivalent | "Program, listing, functions" |
| Enumerate undisassembled ranges | `Listing.getUndefinedRanges` over `Memory.getExecuteSet()` | "Program, listing, functions" |
| Walk the program's version history | `getVersionHistory()` / `getReadOnlyDomainObject` | "Version control and checkpointing" |
| Anything needing a Java interface implementation | `@JImplements` from PyGhidra | "PyGhidra / JPype interop" |

**Submitted scripts run CONCURRENTLY, not queued.** Measured through GhidrAssistMCP's `scripts run`: a
read-only gate submitted alongside an applier's in-transaction rehearsal read the rehearsal's
UNCOMMITTED changes and failed on retypes that were about to roll back. Read-only jobs together are
harmless; any pair where one writes -- a rehearsal counts -- is not. Submit, read the task status, then
submit the next. Origin: re-metal-fatigue §423.

The converse is worth stating too: **MCP is right for orientation** — `get_binary_info`,
`analysis_options` (which analyzers ran, and at what settings), `get_strings`, `xrefs`,
`get_function_statistics`. One `analysis_options` call answered "were the function-start
analyzers even enabled" in seconds, and that is a fact no script should be written to obtain.

## Provenance — `ghidra.program.model.symbol.SourceType`

Constants: `USER_DEFINED`, `IMPORTED`, `ANALYSIS`, `AI`, `DEFAULT`.
Priority: `USER_DEFINED` > `IMPORTED` > `ANALYSIS` = `AI` > `DEFAULT`.
Methods: `getPriority()`, `isHigherPriorityThan(other)`, `isLowerPriorityThan(other)`.

`AI` is documented as *"content produced through AI assistance."* Read a symbol's tier
with `symbol.getSource()`. **Tag every agent mutation `SourceType.AI`; filter it out of
every harvest.**

## Program, listing, functions

```python
currentProgram.getFunctionManager()      # .getFunctions(True), .getExternalFunctions()
currentProgram.getSymbolTable()
currentProgram.getDataTypeManager()
currentProgram.getListing()
currentProgram.getMemory()
currentProgram.getReferenceManager()
currentProgram.getBookmarkManager()
currentProgram.getSourceFileManager()
```

`FlatProgramAPI` / `GhidraScript` conveniences: `toAddr(x)`, `getFunctionAt(addr)`,
`getFunctionContaining(addr)`, `getFunction(name)`, `getInstructionAt(addr)`,
`getDataAt(addr)`, `getBytes(addr, n)`, `getReferencesTo(addr)`,
`getReferencesFrom(addr)`, `getSymbolAt(addr)`, `createLabel(addr, name, makePrimary)`,
`getScriptArgs()`, `createFunction(entry, name)`, `disassemble(addr)`.

**`Listing.getDataAt(addr)` is not an existence test.** For bytes with nothing defined it returns
an `undefined` PLACEHOLDER data unit, not `None`; `getDefinedDataAt(addr)` is the call that means
"is something defined here". Measured (12.3-DEV): a revert's converge step tested
`getDataAt(...) is None`, read the placeholder as "already re-created", skipped the step, and its
own post-check then failed on type `undefined` vs `undefined4`. An earlier run of the same revert
had passed only because the address happened to be defined at the time.

**`SymbolTable.getAllSymbols(True)` yields Function and Label symbols -- never a namespace.**
Measured twice on 12.x (`{'Function': 3732, 'Label': 1728}` by type). A check that looks for
namespace symbols in that iteration can never fire; reach a namespace's symbol through
`label.getParentNamespace().getSymbol()`, and do not count namespaces in an AI-symbol delta
computed from it.

**The decompiler LOCKS the first prototype that reaches an indirect call -- and a call-site
override beats it.** `FuncCallSpecs::forceSet` (fspec.cc) commits the first function-pointer
type that arrives at a CALLIND and "locks the prototype so it doesn't happen again". So when a
global's element type binds a virtual call to the BASE class's vtable first, a receiver local
retyped to the derived class later renames the field (`this->vftable->SetHomePos`) but keeps the
base slot's arguments (`HitMe`'s four, invented as `unaff_*`). A field name and argument types
from two different slots is the signature of the lock. The fix is
`HighFunctionDBUtil.writeOverride(function, callAddress, signature)`, which the decompiler reads
BEFORE analysis. Three things about it, all measured:
- it creates a label `prt_<hash>_<addr>` in a per-function `override` namespace and the namespace
  itself **both SourceType.USER_DEFINED** -- re-tag them if your trust model filters on source;
- it stores a **COPY** of the signature in `/auto_proto` (identical signatures shared), so a later
  change to the slot's definition does NOT reach the call. Gate every override against the
  CURRENT definition it was copied from, not against your own ledger of what you wrote;
- `HighFunctionDBUtil.readOverride(label)` returns it for such a gate.
Measured on one binary: 144 overrides on a typed handle table took the render trade of typing
that table from D5 -57 to +2 on the 365 functions touching it.

**A measurement that mutates can end by DISCARDING rather than reverting.** After apply -> measure
-> revert, the program holds uncommitted transactions whose net effect is nothing, and the next
save/check-in writes an empty version. If nothing is to be kept, close the program without saving
and reopen it: that returns the exact checked-in state. Keep the revert anyway if the tail needs
the program live, and prove it with a re-measure before discarding.

**Count functions consistently.** `getFunctionCount()` **includes** external functions;
`getFunctions(boolean)` returns **non-external** functions only. They differ, so record
which you used — and note two things the obvious reading gets wrong: the boolean is
**direction** (`true` = ascending address order), *not* a filter, and an internal
thunk-to-DLL (a `JMP [IAT]` stub with an entry point in `.text`) **is** returned by it.

### `getCalledFunctions` returns a SET — the ORDER is the thing you wanted

`Function.getCalledFunctions(monitor)` answers *which* functions this one calls. It is a
`Set`, so it drops the two properties that make a large body readable: **sequence and
repetition** *(doc — the return type, not executed here)*. Same for `getCallingFunctions`
and for a bare `getReferencesFrom` sweep once you collect it.

For a body too big to read — a 5 KB main loop, a tick function, a serializer — walk
`listing.getInstructions(body, True)` in address order and emit each `CALL` target as its
own row. What you get is a **call script**: the ordered, duplicate-preserving spine of what
the function does, resolved through import thunks to real names, in a few dozen lines
instead of a few thousand. It is the cheapest instrument for reconciling a reimplemented
loop against the original, and it makes the *shape* of a function legible without
committing to decode it. *(The technique is `tools/callgraph.py` in the third-party project
`gmegidish/crux-re-claude`, done there over raw PE bytes; inside Ghidra the listing gives it
to you with the names already attached.)*

Two things it is not: it is address order, not execution order, so a loop reads once and a
branch reads as if taken; and it says nothing about arguments. Use it to decide *which*
region of a body to actually read — which is the point, since the standing rule is to read
the body before building a producer over it.

## Symbols, namespaces, classes

```python
st.createLabel(addr, name, SourceType.AI)
st.createClass(parentNamespace, name, SourceType.AI)      # a GhidraClass
st.createNameSpace(parentNamespace, name, SourceType.AI)
sym.setName(name, SourceType.AI)
sym.getSource(); sym.getSymbolType(); sym.getParentNamespace()
func.setName(name, SourceType.AI)
func.setParentNamespace(ns)
```

`Function.getName()` returns the **unqualified** name; `getName(True)` includes the
namespace. Comparing the wrong one against a namespace-qualified expectation makes a
check structurally unable to match — a documented repeat failure in this project.

## Data types and structures

`ghidra.program.model.data`:
`StructureDataType`, `UnionDataType`, `EnumDataType`, `TypedefDataType`,
`ArrayDataType`, `PointerDataType`, `FunctionDefinitionDataType`,
`CategoryPath`, `DataTypePath`, `DataTypeConflictHandler`.

```python
s = StructureDataType(CategoryPath("/Game"), "CThing", 0, dtm)
s.add(dt, length, name, comment)
s.insertAtOffset(offset, dt, length, name, comment)
s.replaceAtOffset(offset, dt, length, name, comment)
dtm.addDataType(s, DataTypeConflictHandler.REPLACE_HANDLER)
```

**Mutability** — `MutabilitySettingsDefinition` with constants `NORMAL`, `VOLATILE`,
`CONSTANT`, `WRITABLE`; applied through a `Settings` object on defined data (or per
memory block via the Memory Map). *Marking data `CONSTANT` makes the decompiler show
its contents rather than a pointer to it* — the mechanism for reading through a vtable
or a read-only table. `VOLATILE` stops the decompiler folding repeated hardware-register
reads.

### C++ classes: use Ghidra's own conventions, not hand-rolled structs

`ghidra.program.model.gclass` provides `ClassID` and `ClassUtils`, which encode Ghidra's
convention for modelling C++ classes with vtables. **Check these before hand-building
`<Class>_vftable` structs:**

```python
ClassUtils.isVTable(dataType)
ClassUtils.getVftDefaultEntry(dtm)        # PointerDataType for a vftable slot
ClassUtils.getVftEntrySize(dtm)
ClassUtils.getVbtDefaultEntry(dtm)        # virtual BASE table (virtual inheritance)
ClassUtils.getVbtEntrySize(dtm)
ClassUtils.getClassPath(classId)
ClassUtils.getClassInternalsPath(composite)   # category path for "class internals"
ClassUtils.getSelfBaseType(composite)
ClassUtils.getBaseClassDataTypePath(composite)
ClassUtils.getReplacementPointers(dtm, structure)
ClassUtils.hasClassAttribute(structure)
ClassUtils.createVxTableDescriptionOffsetTag(ptrOffsetInClass)
```

Following these keeps results interoperable with Ghidra's PDB and RTTI machinery instead
of parallel to it.

MSVC RTTI models live in `ghidra.app.util.datatype.microsoft`: `RTTI0DataType` …
`RTTI4DataType`, `MSDataTypeUtils`, `GuidUtil`, `ThreadEnvironmentBlock`. Useful when the
target *has* RTTI; absence (no `.?AV` / `type_info` strings) is a measured finding.

## Function signatures

```python
from ghidra.app.cmd.function import ApplyFunctionSignatureCmd
ApplyFunctionSignatureCmd(entryPoint, signature, SourceType.AI).applyTo(program, monitor)
```

Also in `ghidra.app.cmd.function` (73K of commands): `CreateFunctionCmd`,
`DeleteFunctionCmd`, `SetFunctionNameCmd`, `AddFunctionTagCmd`,
`SetReturnDataTypeCmd`, `SetVariableNameCmd`, `CaptureFunctionDataTypesCmd`,
`ApplyFunctionDataTypesCmd`.

> **`ApplyFunctionDataTypesCmd` is dangerous with a broad address set.** Recorded
> incident: with the whole initialized address set and a large archive it silently
> destroyed two unrelated functions — clean return, no exception. Prefer per-function
> `ApplyFunctionSignatureCmd` over a broad archive apply, and always bracket with an
> invariant diff.

**Listing vs decompiler signature** *(doc)*: with no committed signature the decompiler
synthesizes one from local heuristics, so its display can differ from the Listing and two
call sites of one function can show different signatures. `Commit Params/Return` commits
it. Reading a signature from decompiler output is *not* evidence it is in the database.

## References and overrides

`RefType` constants relevant to overriding control flow:
`CALL_OVERRIDE_UNCONDITIONAL`, `JUMP_OVERRIDE_UNCONDITIONAL`,
`CALLOTHER_OVERRIDE_CALL`, `CALLOTHER_OVERRIDE_JUMP`, plus `COMPUTED_CALL`,
`COMPUTED_JUMP`, `INDIRECTION`.

Adding a primary reference of the appropriate override type at a call/jump site converts an
indirect transfer into a direct one for the decompiler.

**Scope note.** Of the three mechanisms for making virtual dispatch readable (see
`cpp-abi.md`), only this one changes what the *call* is: typing the vtable and marking it
constant make the table and its slots **legible**, but the call site remains indirect and no
call-graph edge appears. So this is the only route to true devirtualization, while the other
two are usually enough if you only need readable output. Decide which you actually need —
this one writes *your inference into the call graph*, so tag it `SourceType.AI` and never
harvest it back as fact.

Commands in `ghidra.app.cmd.refs`: `AddMemRefsCmd`, `AddOffsetMemRefCmd`,
`AddShiftedMemRefCmd`, `AddRegisterRefCmd`, `AddStackRefCmd`, `EditRefTypeCmd`,
`RemoveReferenceCmd`, `AssociateSymbolCmd`, `SetFallThroughCmd`, `ClearFallThroughCmd`.

### Ask the disassembler what an operand DOES — `getOperandRefType`, not operand order

`Instruction.getOperandRefType(i)` returns the `RefType` for operand `i`, carrying `isRead()`,
`isWrite()` and the flow kind. Use it whenever a sweep classifies a memory operand as a read or a
write.

The hand-rolled alternative — *"on x86, operand 0 is the destination"* — is right often enough to
survive review and wrong on the cases that decide a round. It is correct for
`MOV [ESI+0x39c], EBX`; it is **wrong for `CMP dword ptr [ESI+0x39c], EBX`**, whose operand 0 is a
read, and equally wrong for `PUSH`, `TEST`, and every compare. **Measured:** a field census built on
the operand-order heuristic would have reported the single `CMP` that is the *only read of that cell
in the entire program* as a write — turning a test-and-clear latch into a write-only field with no
reader, which is precisely the shape the round was trying to distinguish.

Same family as *"parse with the language's parser, not a regex"*: the tool ships the answer, and the
approximation fails exactly on the instructions nobody thinks to enumerate.

**Operand-scanning idiom**, for finding every `[reg + disp]` access to a struct offset — the route to
reach for when the members are already NAMED, since a decompiled-text scan for placeholder member
spellings is blind to those (`trust-and-circularity.md`):

```python
from ghidra.program.model.lang import Register
from ghidra.program.model.scalar import Scalar

for i in range(instr.getNumOperands()):
    objs    = instr.getOpObjects(i)                 # Register / Scalar / Address
    regs    = [o for o in objs if isinstance(o, Register)]
    scalars = [o for o in objs if isinstance(o, Scalar)]
    if not regs or not scalars:
        continue                                    # immediate, or register-only
    if any(str(r.getName()).upper() in ("ESP", "EBP", "SP", "BP") for r in regs):
        continue                                    # frame slot, never a member
    if any(s.getUnsignedValue() == disp for s in scalars):
        rt = instr.getOperandRefType(i)             # NOT `i == 0`
        yield i, ("write" if rt and rt.isWrite() else "read")
```

Two scope facts worth stating with any result it produces. A **small displacement is not rare** —
`0xc` is any object's fourth dword and is also a member of whatever *other* struct a pointer in the
body happens to point at, so a small-offset census is a **locator**, not a census, and every witness
must be read individually. And a **large displacement scanned program-wide collects other classes'
fields at the same offset**: attribute them from your size and hierarchy artifacts and report the
split, rather than dropping them silently or counting them in.

## Analysis control

```python
analyzeChanges(currentProgram)   # GhidraScript: start analysis, wait for pending
analyzeAll(currentProgram)       # full re-analysis -- avoid on a curated program
```

`GhidraScript.AnalysisMode`: `ENABLED` (default, "Auto-Analysis responding to changes"),
`SUSPENDED` (change events analyzed after the script ends), `DISABLED` (change events
ignored). Both non-default modes wait for pending analysis first.

Surgical, via `AutoAnalysisManager.getAnalysisManager(program)` — **not in the public
javadoc; reachable but unsupported**:

```python
codeDefined(addr | addressSet)
dataDefined(addressSet)
functionDefined(addr | addressSet)
functionModifierChanged(addr | addressSet)
functionSignatureChanged(addr | addressSet)
createFunction(target, findFunctionStart)
createFunction(targetSet, findFunctionStarts, priority)
getAnalyzer(name); cancelQueuedTasks(); getAnalysisTool()
```

Tell it precisely what changed, then `analyzeChanges` — not `analyzeAll`.

**These take an `Address` or an `AddressSetView`, never the `Function` object.**
`functionSignatureChanged(f)` raises `TypeError: No matching overloads found` under PyGhidra.
Measured: an applier wrote exactly that from memory, dry-ran clean (the dry run stops before
the mutation, so it never reached the line), and on `apply` raised one line AFTER
`updateFunction` — leaving the new signature applied with no cascade and no ledger row. Pass
`f.getEntryPoint()`. And give a mutating script an undo for the state its own crash leaves,
not only a revert of its success.

Ghidra's course warns of the **Decompiler Parameter ID** analyzer: run it "too early or
before fixing problems" and you "propagate bad information all over the program." *(doc)*

## Decompiler

```python
from ghidra.app.decompiler import DecompInterface, DecompileOptions
ifc = DecompInterface(); ifc.openProgram(currentProgram)
res = ifc.decompileFunction(func, timeoutSecs, monitor)
res.getDecompiledFunction().getC(); res.getHighFunction()
ifc.dispose()          # always
```

**Batch decompilation** — `ghidra.app.decompiler.parallel`:
`ParallelDecompiler.decompileFunctions(callback, program, functions, monitor)`,
`createChunkingParallelDecompiler(callback, monitor)`, plus `DecompilerCallback`,
`DecompileConfigurer`. Use this for whole-program sweeps rather than looping
`DecompInterface` serially.

`ghidra.program.model.pcode`: `HighFunction`, `HighSymbol`, `HighFunctionDBUtil`
(`updateDBVariable(...)` commits decompiler-level variables to the database),
`PcodeOp`, `Varnode`.

For `this`-relative offset recovery over SSA, do not hand-roll a register tracker — see
`FillOutStructureHelper` under "Read-only witnesses", including which of its arms writes to the
DataTypeManager and why its reach dies on a `__cdecl` prototype.

## Demangling

```python
from ghidra.app.cmd.label import DemanglerCmd
DemanglerCmd(addr, mangledName).applyTo(program, monitor)   # applies NAME and SIGNATURE
```

`ghidra.app.util.demangler` (75K): `DemangledFunction`, `DemangledObject`,
`DemanglerOptions`, `DemanglerUtil`; MSVC specifics in
`ghidra.app.util.demangler.microsoft`.

**To demangle WITHOUT touching the program — and note which entry point you use.** Measured
live on Ghidra 12.1.2: `DemanglerUtil.demangle(program, name, addr)` returns a
**`java.util.List`** of candidate objects, not a `DemangledObject`, so `getDataType()` and
`getSignature()` are simply *absent* on what comes back. A probe built on it reported a type
for **0 of 979** exports and looked like a measured absence rather than a wrong API — an
instrument-manufactured zero, caught only by its own vacuity guard. The single-object entry
point is the demangler class itself:

```python
from ghidra.app.util.demangler.microsoft import MicrosoftDemangler
obj = MicrosoftDemangler().demangle(mangled)   # -> DemangledObject, or None
obj.getSignature(False)   # 'public virtual void __thiscall CMessage::Dwim(union HGOBJECT, ...)'
obj.getDataType()         # on a DemangledVariable: 'class CWorld *'
```

It needs no `Function`, no applied data and no analysis to have run, which makes it usable as
an independent second decoder over a whole export table. It also spells every user-defined
type with its C++ tag word (`class` / `struct` / `union` / `enum`), so extracting the type
tokens from its rendering is a genuinely different code path from parsing the mangling's own
`V`/`U`/`T`/`W` codes — the two share nothing but the input bytes, which is what makes their
agreement worth something (`references/cpp-abi.md`). Ghidra 12.1 added Microsoft demangler **output
options** controlling user-defined-type tags and anonymous-namespace naming *(doc)*.
Rust demangling: `ghidra.app.plugin.core.analysis.rust.demangler`.

MSVC mangled names encode the declaring class, the access/virtual specifier (the character
after `@@` — `Q` public non-virtual, `U` public virtual, `M` protected virtual,
`S` public static, `E` private virtual), and the full parameter list. `??_7Class@@6B@` is a
**vftable** symbol whose address is the class's vtable.

## Source map — the native home for `__FILE__` evidence

`currentProgram.getSourceFileManager()` (`ghidra.program.model.sourcemap`):

```python
sfm.addSourceFile(sourceFile)
sfm.addSourceMapEntry(sourceFile, lineNumber, addressRange)
sfm.addSourceMapEntry(sourceFile, lineNumber, baseAddr, length)
sfm.getSourceMapEntries(addr)                      # what source is this address from?
sfm.getSourceMapEntries(sourceFile)                # every address from this file
sfm.getSourceMapEntries(sourceFile, minLine, maxLine)
sfm.getAllSourceFiles(); sfm.getMappedSourceFiles()
```

When assert strings leak original source paths, record them as **real source map
entries** rather than comments. The mapping is then queryable in both directions, which
effectively reconstructs the original translation units as first-class program data.

## Byte pattern search

`ghidra.util.bytesearch`: `DittedBitSequence` (wildcarded patterns), `Pattern`,
`PatternPairSet` (pre/post patterns — the function-start-pattern mechanism),
`MemoryBytePatternSearcher`, `ProgramMemorySearcher`, `BulkPatternSearcher`,
`GenericMatchAction`, `DummyMatchAction`, `AlignRule`, `PostRule`, `Match`,
`PatternFactory`, `MatchAction`. Also `ghidra.features.base.memsearch.*` for the
memory-search API.

Use for custom function-start signatures (attacking undefined-code backlogs) and library
fingerprinting — **and to ask what the shipped function-start analyzer would do, without
running it.** The whole pipeline is drivable from a script, which is strictly better than
reimplementing ditted-bit matching:

```python
from ghidra.app.analyzers import Patterns              # Features/BytePatterns
from ghidra.util.bytesearch import Pattern, MemoryBytePatternSearcher
from java.util import ArrayList

tree  = Patterns.getPatternDecisionTree()               # patternconstraints.xml
Patterns.hasPatternFiles(program, tree)                 # bool
files = Patterns.findPatternFiles(program, tree)        # ResourceFile[] — ASK, don't assume
pats  = ArrayList()
for f in files:
    Pattern.readPatterns(f, pats, factory)              # factory: your PatternFactory
searcher = MemoryBytePatternSearcher("probe", pats)
searcher.setSearchExecutableOnly(True)
searcher.searchAll(program, monitor)                    # or .search(program, addressSet, monitor)
```

Four things the javadoc does not tell you, all read from the source and all load-bearing:

- **A pattern file is a cross product filtered by an information budget, not a list of byte
  strings.** `PatternPairSet.createFinalPatterns` pairs each prepattern with each postpattern
  and keeps the concatenation only if `postcheck >= postBitsOfCheck` **and**
  `precheck + postcheck >= totalBitsOfCheck`, counting **fixed (non-ditted) bits**. With
  `x86win_patterns.xml`'s `totalbits="32" postbits="16"`, the pair `0x90` (8 fixed bits) with
  `0x83ec 0.....00` (19) totals 27 and **is never built** — so a prologue that visibly matches
  can be one the engine never had a pattern for. `Pattern.getMarkOffset()` is the prepattern
  length, i.e. the match address is the proposed function start.
- **The seam that makes this read-only is the `MatchAction`, not the search.**
  `ghidra.app.analyzers.FunctionStartAnalyzer` **is** the production `PatternFactory`, and
  instantiating it is not read-only: its `applyActionToSet` calls `func.setNoReturn(true)` and
  writes an `AddressSetPropertyMap`. Both `PatternFactory` (`getMatchActionByName`,
  `getPostRuleByName`) and `MatchAction` (`apply`, `restoreXml`) are plain interfaces, so
  `@JImplements` works; return a fresh recording action per tag so each pattern keeps its own
  attributes, and mirror `DummyMatchAction` by consuming the element in `restoreXml`.
- **The XML attributes are post-match PREREQUISITES, checked long after the bytes match**, in
  `FunctionStartAnalyzer.checkPreRequisites`. Count hits without reading them and you will
  report padding as candidates. `validcode="function"` requires an **existing** function at the
  address; `validcode="N"` runs `PseudoDisassembler.checkValidSubroutine`; `after=` runs
  `checkAfterName`, whose branches are `func` / `inst` / `data` / `ptr` / `def`, and whose
  fallback `pureDataReferencesOnly` **opens by refusing an address with no references at all**.
  Also `label=`, `noreturn=`, `thunk=`, `contiguous=`, `section=`.
- **`funcstart` and `possiblefuncstart` are different tiers and both create functions.** The
  first goes to `funcResult` → `analysisManager.createFunction`; the second to
  `potentialFuncResult` → a scheduled `PossibleDelayedFunctionCreator`. And
  `applyActionToSet` silently drops any address failing
  `addr % language.getInstructionAlignment() != 0` (1 on x86, so never).

**Calibrate a borrowed engine like any other witness**: run it over the whole program and
require a large share of matches to land on functions that already exist. Measured on one
binary, 140 final patterns → 2,905 matches, **1,205 (41.5%) on known function starts**. Without
that arm, "0 matches in the region I care about" is a fact about your wiring.

## Read-only witnesses — analysis without mutation

Three shipped helpers answer questions worth asking without writing to the program. All three
have an arm that *does* write, and in two cases it is not the arm you would guess, so the rule
is the same each time: **read the source for which arm mutates, then bracket the run with a
datatype/function-count diff that raises.** The source read is the hypothesis; the bracket is
the evidence.

### `PseudoDisassembler` (`ghidra.app.util`)

Genuinely read-only by its own javadoc — *"no references, symbols are created or will be
saved"*, and it needs no open transaction.

```python
pd = PseudoDisassembler(program)
pd.isValidSubroutine(addr)                              # returns, no bad instrs, one entry, no overlap
pd.isValidSubroutine(addr, allowExistingCode)           # allow flowing into existing instructions
pd.isValidSubroutine(addr, allowExistingCode, mustTerminate)
pd.checkValidSubroutine(addr, ctx, allowExisting, mustTerminate, contiguous)
pd.disassemble(addr)                                    # -> PseudoInstruction (also (addr, bytes[]))
pd.isValidCode(addr[, ctx]); pd.followSubFlows(entry, maxInstr, processor)
pd.setMaxInstructions(n); pd.getLastCheckValidInstructionCount()
```

**Use `allowExistingCode=True` when testing a KNOWN function start** — the default form requires
not overlapping existing instructions, so it refuses every function you already have and the
recall arm reads as a broken instrument.

**Measured calibration, and it is the reason to distrust it as a discriminator: 400 of 400
sampled known function starts accepted (100% recall) and 288 of 400 sampled function INTERIORS
also accepted — a 72% false-accept rate.** So "N undisassembled ranges decode cleanly" is close
to information-free. It is a sanity filter, not evidence. Grade it in both directions before
believing any count it produces.

### `FillOutStructureHelper` (`ghidra.app.decompiler.util`)

The same witness as a hand-rolled `this`-offset tracker, but over decompiler SSA — so it crosses
basic blocks via `MULTIEQUAL` phis and, given a `DecompInterface`, recurses into CALLs.

```python
h   = FillOutStructureHelper(program, monitor)
lib = h.setUpDecompiler(DecompileOptions())             # pins setSimplificationStyle("decompile")
var = h.computeHighVariable(storageAddr, func, lib)     # HighVariable at that storage, or None
h.processStructure(var, func, True, False, lib)         # (createNewStructure, createClassIfNeeded)
h.getStorePcodeOps(); h.getLoadPcodeOps()               # List<OffsetPcodeOpPair>
h.getComponentMap()                                     # NoisyStructureBuilder
```

**Which arm mutates — the opposite of the intuitive reading:**

| arguments | effect |
|---|---|
| `createNewStructure=True, createClassIfNeeded=False` | **read-only.** `createUniqueStructure` builds a `StructureDataType` and **never adds it to the DTM**; `populateStructure` edits that detached object. Take the op lists, discard the Structure. |
| `createNewStructure=False` | **rewrites an existing type.** `getStructureForExtending` fetches the struct *out of the DTM* and then `growStructure` / `replaceAtOffset` run on it — i.e. it overwrites the very layout you meant to cross-check. |
| `createClassIfNeeded=True` on a `this` param | **mutates and launders.** `createUniqueClassNamespaceAndStructure` calls `symbolTable.createClass(..., SourceType.USER_DEFINED)`, moves the function with `RenameLabelCmd(..., USER_DEFINED)`, and `VariableUtilities.findOrCreateClassStruct`. |

Three more caveats, all measured:

- **The returned ops are not confined to the function you passed** — `pushIntoCalls` walks into
  callees. Ghidra's own caller filters them (`RecoveredClassHelper.removePcodeOpsNotInFunction`).
  Filter with `func.getBody().contains(op.getPcodeOp().getSeqnum().getTarget())`, and report
  both counts: the unconfined set is what compares to a construction-chain walk, the confined
  set to a single body.
- **It is decompiler-derived, so it inherits every signature and type you applied.** Agreement
  on a class you have already typed may be a tautology; agreement on an untyped one is a real
  second witness. Split the population before quoting an agreement count.
- **Its precondition is a locatable receiver, and that is where reach dies.** It needs a
  `HighVariable` at the receiver's storage. On a `__thiscall`/`__fastcall` body that is ECX; on
  a `__cdecl` one ECX is not an input at all and `computeHighVariable` returns `None`. Measured:
  198 of 198 classes had a recorded constructor site — and 173 of those sites are **factories the
  constructor was inlined into**, correctly `__cdecl`, so pointing it at the recorded site reached
  only **25**. Census `getCallingConventionName()` over the population before pricing anything on
  it, and check what each site actually IS before calling a convention wrong: an inlined-constructor
  factory is not a member function and has no receiver to declare.

  **But do not price the reach on one entry point per class.** Any non-static member takes `this`,
  so a class with no usable constructor is still reachable through a namespace member or a vtable
  slot target — which took the same population from 25 to **198 of 198**. If you use slot targets,
  drop the ones shared through inheritance first (a target in more than one attributed table is a
  base's method); measured 560 of 1322 shared, 0 classes dependent on a shared one. Do **not** reach for `getParameter(0)`'s storage
  instead: that is `this` only under `__thiscall`, and under `__cdecl` it is the first *stack*
  argument, which yields a `HighVariable` every time and produces no cells — a failure that
  reads as a quiet witness rather than a wrong question.

- **It follows the pointer's VALUE through `COPY` and `MULTIEQUAL`, so on a class hierarchy it
  will attribute a DERIVED class's fields to a BASE pointer — and the confinement filter does not
  help, because the contaminating accesses are in the same body.** Measured on a 1999 MSVC binary:
  driven from a base-class pointer whose type comes from the binary's own export mangling, it
  reached offset **624** — past the *entire* 496-byte allocation of a class deriving from that
  base, i.e. an impossible lower bound for the base. The mechanism is ordinary C++: the base
  pointer is copied into a list-walk iterator, the iterator is narrowed by a type-tag test, and
  only then are the derived fields touched. The helper sees one dataflow.

  **Two things follow.** First, **assert on the inverted interval**: a lower bound above a
  structurally independent upper bound is a defect, not a measurement, and printing it invites the
  reader to split the difference. Second, **find the mechanism that causes the narrowing and make
  that the discriminator** — here, *does this pointer's flow READ the type tag*. Partitioning on
  that separated the population completely and with no tuning (6 tag-reading variables reaching
  624, 18 non-tag-reading ones reaching 496, and the narrowed group landing inside the derived
  class's own size). **A threshold you have to tune to separate a population is a fitted
  parameter; one that separates it exactly is a mechanism.** Assert both the discriminator's
  identity and the coherence bound rather than assuming them.

- **`Function.getLocalVariables()` returns the COMMITTED (database) variables, not what the
  decompiler sees, and on a stripped binary those differ by an order of magnitude.** A population
  built from `getParameters()` + `getLocalVariables()` is a population of *what someone has
  already written down*. Measured: a probe built that way found 19 functions holding a pointer to
  the class of interest; the idiom that actually carries it is a decompiler-only local —
  `T *local_14; while (SearchT(this, &local_14, &end)) { ... }` — so every iterator site was
  structurally outside the population, including the one function that settled the question.
  **The omission produces no error, no warning and no skip counter**: the probe simply reports a
  smaller world, and its number reads as a fact about the program.

  To enumerate what the **decompiler** believes, go through
  `HighFunction.getLocalSymbolMap().getSymbols()` and take `sym.getHighVariable()` /
  `sym.getStorage()`. To enumerate what a **human** has recorded, use `getLocalVariables()` (or
  `getAllVariables()`, which adds the parameters). They are different questions and the second one
  is almost never the one you meant.

  **Audit what such a predicate FEEDS before grading how bad it is — the same under-count has
  opposite signatures depending on the consumer.** Feeding a *population* or a *census*, it is a
  silent understatement. Feeding a **control group**, it depends entirely on whether anything
  checks that group: where the control is only a denominator, contamination biases the result
  toward "no effect" invisibly; where the control is a **must-not-change assertion that raises**,
  the identical under-count instead produces a *loud false alarm*, and the failure mode to guard
  is the tempting fix — widening the control group until the strays fall out of it — rather than
  finding the dependency route the predicate is missing. Measured on one project: two applies
  splitting every function that way were graded "contaminated control" from the selection code
  alone; both consumers turned out to be instrumented (one raising twice, one printing every stray
  for adjudication), and one had already gained **two extra dependency routes** — globals typed
  with a target class, and functions referencing an embedded element table's byte range — because
  those gates fired. Read the consumer.

### `AlignedStructureInspector` (`ghidra.program.model.data`)

`packComponents(structureInternal)` → `StructurePackResult` (`.structureLength`, `.alignment`)
computes an MSVC-packed size **without touching the DTM**. Turns a candidate layout into a
hypothesis test: alignment alone narrows a size interval, and a `double` member narrows it
further. Narrowing, never deciding. *(doc — not executed here.)*

## Correlation across builds

`ghidra.program.model.correlate`: `HashedFunctionAddressCorrelation`,
`HashCalculator`, `MnemonicHashCalculator`, `AllBytesHashCalculator`, `HashStore`,
`DisambiguateByParent`/`ByChild`/`ByBytes`.

`ghidra.features.bsim.*` — BSim similarity database and query API (`query.facade`,
`query.protocol`, `query.client`). For matching a stripped build against a build with
symbols, or identifying library code. Tutorials in `docs/GhidraClass/BSim/`.

## Emulation

**Current:** `ghidra.pcode.emu` — `PcodeEmulator`, `PcodeMachine`, `PcodeThread`,
`EmulatorUtilities`, `PcodeEmulationCallbacks`. `PcodeMachine.inject(Address, sleigh)`
stubs out imports the emulator cannot execute, which is what makes an era-typical Win32
binary emulable at all. Worked examples ship in
`Ghidra/Features/SystemEmulation/ghidra_scripts/` (`StandAloneEmuExampleScript.java`,
`EmuDeskCheckScript.java`).

**Deprecated:** `ghidra.app.emulator` (`EmulatorHelper`, `Emulator`, `DefaultEmulator`,
`EmulatorConfiguration`, `MemoryAccessFilter`, `FilteredMemoryState`). 12.1.2's own stub for
`EmulatorHelper` says *"This is part of the older p-code emulation system… deprecated::
Please use `PcodeEmulator` instead."* Keep it only for `enableMemoryWriteTracking()` /
`getTrackedMemoryWriteSet()`, which have no direct replacement.

Run a routine without the target running — decompression, checksum, decryption, table
generation. Set registers and memory, run to an address, read results. Course material:
`docs/GhidraClass/Debugger/B2-Emulation`.

## Version control and checkpointing

```python
df = currentProgram.getDomainFile()
df.isVersioned(); df.isCheckedOut(); df.getLatestVersion()
currentProgram.isChanged()
end(True)                                     # close the script's transaction FIRST
currentProgram.save(comment, monitor)
df.checkin(checkinHandler, monitor)           # handler via @JImplements(CheckinHandler)
df.addToVersionControl(comment, keepCheckedOut, monitor)
df.packFile(file, monitor)                    # .gzf snapshot of the PERSISTED state
```

`packFile` serializes the last-**saved** state, so snapshot **after** save or the archive
silently captures the previous version. `"File has unsaved changes"` from `checkin` is
literal.

## Debug information

**`ghidra.app.util.bin.format.pdb2.pdbreader` is the CURRENT reader** — a pure-Java,
cross-platform implementation (~600 files) driven by the **`PdbUniversalAnalyzer`**, so it
works off-Windows and needs no DIA SDK. The older `ghidra.app.util.bin.format.pdb`,
`docs/README_PDB.html` and `support/README_createPdbXmlFiles.txt` describe the **legacy**
native `pdb.exe`/XML route, whose README still predicts the pure-Java implementation that
has since arrived. Prefer `pdb2`; reach for the legacy path only if Universal fails.
`ghidra.app.util.bin.format.dwarf` is a large, full DWARF implementation with
`dwarf.line` (line numbers), `dwarf.external` and `sectionprovider`; Ghidra 12.1 added
**debuginfod** downloads and a `$HOME/.cache/debuginfod_client` search. Golang and Swift
metadata have their own packages (`format.golang.rtti`, `format.swift.types`), as does
Objective-C (`format.objc`).

**Check for debug info before doing anything else on a Windows or ELF target.** It
subsumes most of the evidence-gathering this methodology otherwise does by hand.

## Exporting

**For a C header of recovered TYPES, use `ghidra.program.model.data.DataTypeWriter(dtm,
writer)`** — public, supported, and documented as *"A class used to convert data types into
ANSI-C. The ANSI-C code should compile on most platforms."*

**Do not try to use `CppExporter.CPPResult`.** It is a **private nested record**
(`record CPPResult(Address, String headerCode, String bodyCode, List<String> globals)`),
not reachable from a script and absent from the javadoc; `CppExporter` itself **decompiles
the whole program** as a side effect and is driven by options `CREATE_C_FILE`,
`CREATE_HEADER_FILE`, `USE_CPP_STYLE_COMMENTS`, `EMIT_TYPE_DEFINITONS` (Ghidra's typo),
`EMIT_REFERENCED_GLOBALS`. Its type emission delegates to `DataTypeWriter` anyway.

**No built-in emits compile-time offset assertions**, so wrap the generated types with
`_Static_assert(offsetof(T,f)==K)` and `sizeof` checks yourself and compile them — that
compile is the only step that recomputes offsets from the C object model rather than from
your own arithmetic.

Other exporters in `ghidra.app.util.exporter` cover XML, HTML, ASCII and binary; the SARIF
exporter lives in `Ghidra/Features/Sarif`.

## Headless automation

`support/analyzeHeadless` — batch runs with no GUI. Verified options include:
`-import`, `-process`, `-recursive`, `-preScript <name> [args]`,
`-postScript <name> [args]`, `-scriptPath`, `-propertiesPath`, `-scriptlog`, `-log`,
`-noanalysis`, `-analysisTimeoutPerFile <s>`, `-processor <languageID>`,
`-cspec <compilerSpecID>`, `-loader`, `-librarySearchPaths`, `-max-cpu <n>`,
`-readOnly`, `-deleteProject`, `-okToDelete`, `-commit`, `-connect`, `-keystore`, `-p`.

Two matter for methodology:

- **`-readOnly`** guarantees only that changes are **not persisted**: the README says
  imported files "will NOT be saved" and that in `-process` mode any changes "are
  **discarded**". It does **not** prevent mutation during the run, so a script can still
  apply names and a later `-postScript` in the same chain can still harvest them. It is a
  containment mechanism, not an anti-circularity one — do not treat it as a guarantee that
  a pass was evidence-only.
- **`-process`** operates on a program already in a project, so a headless pipeline can
  drive the same database an interactive session uses, with `-preScript`/`-postScript`
  bracketing.

## PyGhidra / JPype interop — the errors that cost time

- **A Java collection parameter needs a Java collection.** `dtm.findDataTypes(name, [])` fails
  with *"No matching overloads found"* against a signature it obviously matches; pass
  `java.util.ArrayList`. Same shape as the `java.lang.Object` consumer required by
  `getReadOnlyDomainObject`.
- **Implement Ghidra interfaces with `@JImplements` / `@JOverride`** (`from jpype import ...`).
  Verified on `PatternFactory`, `MatchAction` and `ContextEvaluator` — all plain interfaces.
  This is what lets you substitute one step of a shipped pipeline while keeping the rest real.
- **`getBytes(addr, n)` returns a Java `byte[]`; `bytes(ba)` converts it** via the buffer
  protocol, giving unsigned values directly. Do this once per memory block and use
  `bytes.find` — a per-byte `mem.getByte()` loop over a megabyte is minutes, this is instant.
  Assert the returned length equals what you asked for: a partial read silently shifts every
  offset you compute afterwards.
- **Type-check against INTERFACES, not implementation classes** — a datatype read back from the
  DTM is a `FunctionDefinitionDB`, not the `FunctionDefinitionDataType` you constructed.
- **`state`, `currentProgram`, `currentAddress`, `monitor`, `script` are reserved
  `GhidraScript` globals.** Assigning to `state` raises `ClassCastException` from a property
  setter, reported far from the offending line.
- **Never derive a path from `__file__`** in an installed script; resolve from a constants
  module.

## Facts about the program you will want and may not think to ask for

```python
listing.getUndefinedRanges(mem.getExecuteSet(), True, monitor).getAddressRanges()
```
Every byte in executable memory the disassembler never touched — an `AddressSet`, so ask it for
`getAddressRanges()`. **Classify these by CONTENT before quoting the total**: measured, 5,033 of
5,321 ranges were pure `0xCC`/`0x00`/`0x90` alignment filler, so the honest population was 236
ranges, not 5,321.

```python
ins.getFlowType()      # .isTerminal() .isJump() .hasFallthrough() .isCall() .isConditional()
```
The authority on whether control leaves an instruction — **ask this, never a mnemonic list**.
Its use for grading a whole evidence base: if a defined function's last instruction still falls
through, that body is truncated in the database and every witness that walks function bodies has
been reading a partial function. Calibrate over the whole corpus first (measured: 5,628 of 5,629
functions end in a flow terminator) so the answer is a measurement, not a property of the probe.

```python
func.getCallingConventionName()   # '__cdecl' / '__thiscall' / '__fastcall' / None
func.getSignatureSource()         # DEFAULT | ANALYSIS | IMPORTED | USER_DEFINED | AI
dtm.getDataTypeCount(True)        # cheap invariant for a mutation bracket
```
Check the SOURCE before planning to overwrite a signature: `AI` and `ANALYSIS` are both priority
2, so an AI-tagged replacement of an analyzer-committed prototype is a **peer overwrite** the
next `analyzeChanges` is entitled to reverse.

```python
refMgr.getReferenceDestinationIterator(addressSetView, True)   # what is referenced in a region
refMgr.getReferencesTo(addr); refMgr.getReferenceCountTo(addr)
```
Remember these are claims about the **database**: a reference from bytes never disassembled does
not exist here. Byte-search for an address before recording any reference-count zero.

*The four sections below moved here from `SKILL.md` in the 2026-08-23
restructure: cascade triggers, the built-in-before-you-hand-roll table, driving
Ghidra in library mode, and the PyGhidra scripting rules.*

## Cascade triggers, scoped

Auto-analysis is `ENABLED` by default during scripts ("Auto-Analysis responding to
changes"), so mutations can trigger analysis *while your loop runs* and you may read
half-analyzed state. Mutate first, analyze deliberately.

- `analyzeChanges(program)` — "Starts auto-analysis if not started and waits for pending
  analysis to complete." **The sanctioned trigger.**
- `analyzeAll(program)` — full re-analysis. Reckless on a curated program; can undo
  curation. Avoid.
- Surgical: `AutoAnalysisManager.getAnalysisManager(program)` exposes
  `codeDefined(addr|set)`, `functionDefined(addr|set)`,
  `functionSignatureChanged(addr|set)`, `dataDefined(set)`,
  `createFunction(target, findFunctionStart)`, `getAnalyzer(name)`,
  `cancelQueuedTasks()`. Tell it what changed, then `analyzeChanges`. Not in the public
  javadoc — reachable but unsupported.
- `GhidraScript.AnalysisMode`: `ENABLED` (live), `SUSPENDED` (queued until the script
  ends), `DISABLED` (change events ignored).

## Check for a built-in before writing your own

We wrote a vtable sweeper from scratch without checking that the first item existed.

| Need | Built-in |
|---|---|
| Find function-pointer / vtable tables | `Search → For Address Tables` |
| Model a C++ class with vtables | `ClassUtils` / `ClassID` (`ghidra.program.model.gclass`) — a whole convention, don't hand-roll |
| MSVC RTTI structures | `RTTI0DataType`…`RTTI4DataType`, `MSDataTypeUtils` (`ghidra.app.util.datatype.microsoft`) |
| Infer struct fields from access patterns | GUI: Auto Create / Auto Fill in Structure, **Auto Fill in Class Structure** for a known `this`. **Programmatic: `FillOutStructureHelper`** (`ghidra.app.decompiler.util`) — `processStructure(highVar, func, createNewStructure, createClassIfNeeded, decomplib)`, then **`getStorePcodeOps()` / `getLoadPcodeOps()`** for `(offset, PcodeOp)` pairs and `getComponentMap()` for a `NoisyStructureBuilder` |
| Compute an MSVC-packed size WITHOUT mutating the DTM | `AlignedStructureInspector.packComponents(structureInternal)` → `StructurePackResult` (`.structureLength`, `.alignment`) — hypothesis-testing for a candidate layout |
| Set data constant / volatile | `MutabilitySettingsDefinition`: `NORMAL`/`CONSTANT`/`VOLATILE`/`WRITABLE` |
| Parse C headers into the program | `CParserUtils.parseHeaderFiles(...)` (C only, not C++) |
| Open a `.gdt` type archive with no tool | `FileDataTypeManager.openFileArchive(file, false)` |
| **Decompile many functions** | `ParallelDecompiler.decompileFunctions(...)` — never loop `DecompInterface` serially over a whole program |
| **Record `__FILE__` / source-path evidence** | `program.getSourceFileManager().addSourceMapEntry(file, line, range)` — queryable both ways, not a comment |
| Custom function-start signatures, library fingerprints | `ghidra.util.bytesearch`: `DittedBitSequence`, `PatternPairSet`, `MemoryBytePatternSearcher` |
| Find more functions in undefined bytes | `RandomForestFunctionFinderPlugin` (MachineLearning extension) — trains on functions already found |
| Identify library code | Function ID (FID); **BSim** for similarity search across corpora |
| Compare two builds / match stripped against symbolled | Version Tracking, BSim, `ghidra.program.model.correlate` (`HashedFunctionAddressCorrelation`, `MnemonicHashCalculator`) |
| Unrecovered switch / jumptable | `FindUnrecoveredSwitchesScript.java`, `SwitchOverride.java` |
| Non-returning-function damage | `FixupNoReturnFunctionsScript.java` |
| Run a routine without the game | **`PcodeEmulator`** (`ghidra.pcode.emu`; `PcodeMachine.inject(addr, sleigh)` stubs unemulatable imports). `EmulatorHelper` is **deprecated** as of 12.1 — keep it only for `enableMemoryWriteTracking()`/`getTrackedMemoryWriteSet()`. Examples in `Features/SystemEmulation/ghidra_scripts/` |
| Discard changes after a headless pass | `analyzeHeadless -readOnly` — it guarantees nothing is **persisted**; it does *not* prevent mutation within the run, so a later `-postScript` can still read this run's own applies. Containment, not anti-circularity |
| Batch/pipeline runs | `analyzeHeadless -process -preScript -postScript -noanalysis` |
| Preview bytes without committing | Disassembled View window |
| **Emit recovered types as C** | `DataTypeWriter(dtm, writer)` — public and supported. Not `CppExporter.CPPResult`, a private record whose exporter decompiles the whole program |
| **Measure what a round actually changed** | `ProgramDiff` + `ProgramDiffFilter` → `AddressSetView`; `ProgramMerge` to restore one category from a checkpoint |
| Recover C++ classes wholesale | `RecoverClassesFromRTTIScript` + the `classrecovery` package — **gates on RTTI**, so a `/GR-` binary gets nothing, and that is what licenses hand-rolling |
| C++ classes on 32-bit MSVC with **no** RTTI | Pharos **OOAnalyzer** (`--ignore-rtti`) via **CERT Kaiju**. Candidates only: destructor F1 0.41, member offsets unpublished |
| Devirtualize a call site | `AddVfunctionCallRefScript` (12.1) — needs components typed `Pointer`→`FunctionDefinition` (NOT the `ClassUtils` default pointer), is cursor-driven, writes `ANALYSIS`, and its unique-instance inference is unsound for any class with descendants. Read the caveats before planning on it |
| Dataflow across basic blocks | `DecompilerUtils.getBackwardSliceToPCodeOps` (SSA p-code); `SymbolicPropogator` for `this + K` without the decompiler |
| Identify the build toolchain | `ghidra.app.util.bin.format.pe.rich` + `PortableExecutableRichPrintScript` — the PE Rich header names the compilers and linkers used |
| **Test if a subroutine starts here, WITHOUT mutating** | `PseudoDisassembler` (`ghidra.app.util`) — `isValidSubroutine(addr[, allowExistingCode[, mustTerminate]])`, `isValidCode`, `disassemble(addr)` → `PseudoInstruction`, `followSubFlows`. Creates no references or symbols and needs no transaction. **Calibrate it: measured 100% recall on known starts and a 72% FALSE-ACCEPT rate on known function interiors** — it is a sanity filter, not a discriminator |
| Attack undefined code | `Processors/x86/data/patterns/x86win_patterns.xml` (real MSVC prologue/filler pairs — **extend the XML**, don't write pattern code); `FindUndefinedFunctionsScript`, `MakeFunctionsScript`, `CreateFunctionAfterTerminals`, `DumpFunctionPatternInfoScript` |
| Build a FID database from period libs | `ImportMSLibs`, `CreateEmptyFidDatabase`, `CreateMultipleLibraries`, `RepackFid`; procedure in `data/building_fid.txt` |
| **Carry provenance inside the program** | `FunctionTag` (name + comment, DB-backed, and `CppExporter` can filter on it) — tag every function a round touches with the round id, and the ledger becomes reconstructible *from the program* instead of only from your CSV. `BookmarkType.{NOTE,ANALYSIS,WARNING}` for "recorded unresolved" caveats that travel with the address | **Also: a PLATE comment at every address you named, so the GUI reader sees it** — measured, 3618 of them over 1909 functions and 1709 data symbols, with `functions_total` and the AI-symbol count asserted unmoved and a full read-only-sweep harness confirming 0 artifacts perturbed. Make the text rename-proof: say *the name here is ours*, never quote the name, or you have planted one stale copy per address
| Record the analyzer configuration | `pyghidra.analysis_properties(program)` — results are a function of it, so a metrics row omitting it is not a reproducible snapshot |
| Machine-readable export for replay debt | `ghidra.app.util.xml.*Mgr`, and the shipped **SARIF** exporter (`Features/Sarif`) — both carry the `SourceType` laundering hazard in `references/trust-and-circularity.md` |

## How to drive Ghidra — prefer library mode

**Default to PyGhidra as a library, from plain CPython.** `pyghidra.start()` →
`open_project()` → `program_context()` → `with pyghidra.transaction(program, "round 5
apply"):` → `analyze()`. Also there: `consume_program()`, `analysis_properties()`,
`ghidra_script()`, `walk_programs()`. (PyGhidra 3.0, shipped with 12.0, deprecates the older
`open_program()`/`run_script()` in favour of these.)

This is not a style preference. **Library mode structurally eliminates three of the four
hazards below**: no install step means no stale-copy shadowing, no async task means no
unread result, and your own repo is on `sys.path` so paths resolve where you wrote them.
You also get real tracebacks. The one constraint: headless cannot open a project that is
already open in the GUI, so pick one at a time.

Reserve **MCP for interactive reads** against a live GUI session. When you *do* run scripts
through Ghidra, these apply:

- **Editing a script in your repo does nothing.** Re-install into Ghidra's user script
  directory before every run (`action="create"`, `overwrite=true`) — **library modules
  included**: Ghidra's script dir sits earlier on `sys.path` than an appended repo path,
  so a stale installed copy shadows your edit silently and you debug logic that is not
  running.
- **`action="run"` is asynchronous.** It returns a task id; nothing is verified until you
  read `get_task_status`. Never report a result you have not read.
- A `create` response may misreport the provider (`<unsupported>`, `Jython`). Cosmetic —
  the `run` result reports the real one.
- Prefer one script run over hundreds of per-item MCP calls; and only a script can set
  `SourceType`.

## Scripting rules (PyGhidra)

- **CPython 3 via PyGhidra**, not Jython — `except X as e`, f-strings, real imports. As
  of Ghidra 12.1 Jython is an opt-in extension, so a `# @runtime Jython` tag fails before
  the first line unless installed. Ghidra 12.1 needs JDK 21+.
- Wrap DB modification in a transaction; `GhidraScript` opens one and `end(True)` closes
  it (required before save/checkin).
- **`end(False)` is a valid rehearsal, but its rollback lands LATER than the call, and a raise
  does not roll back at all.** Measured (12.1.2, a script run through an MCP script runner):
  a dry run that creates functions, measures, and calls `end(False)` still READ the functions
  afterwards in the same script. The script's transaction was nested inside the runner's;
  `DomainObjectDBTransaction.endEntry` only marks the entry aborted, and the database rolls
  back when the outermost transaction closes (`DomainObjectTransactionManager.endTransaction`,
  in `Project-src.zip`). So verify a rehearsal's rollback with the NEXT run, never a read in
  the same one. And `GhidraScript.executeNormal` ends the script transaction with `end(true)`
  in a `finally`, so an exception COMMITS whatever was written: a rehearsal must abort BEFORE
  evaluating any check that can raise, and an apply-mode post-check that raises leaves the
  mutation in the (unsaved) program — write the recovery path into the script header.
- **Never bind a GhidraScript builtin as a variable** — `end`, `start`, `monitor`, `currentProgram`,
  `askString` and the rest are module-level names in a PyGhidra script, so `end = off + width` in a
  loop silently replaces `end()`. Measured: a rehearsal's rollback `end(False)` then raised
  `TypeError: 'int' object is not callable`, and — per the rule above — the runner's `end(true)`
  COMMITTED every rehearsal write into the open program. Only the next dry run's guards noticed.
  The same class has a SECOND failure mode: a JPype bean PROPERTY (`getControls()` -> `controls`) is
  not shadowed but refuses assignment (`property ... has no setter`), raising at that line. Derive the
  name set from the javadoc (methods + get/is-derived properties), not the Python stubs -- a stub-based
  sweep missed `end` itself.
- **`setNoReturn(True)` is a program-wide mutation.** Measured: one flag on a 468-site error helper made
  the cascade create a function, clear code outside its predicted fall-through, rewrite 12 unrelated
  prototypes and demote AI-sourced signatures (the AI = ANALYSIS tie). Rehearse it ALONE.
- **Splitting a merged decompiler variable is scriptable.** Ghidra's "Split Out As New Variable"
  (`IsolateVariableTask.commit`) is `nhv = highFunction.splitOutMergeGroup(high, vn)` followed by
  `HighFunctionDBUtil.updateDBVariable(nhv.getSymbol(), newName, dataType, SourceType.AI)`; the
  committed local is type-locked, hence isolated, and survives re-decompilation. Two traps: on a
  variable with ONE merge group it silently returns the same variable (so the "split" retypes
  every use — check `len({vn.getMergeGroup()})>=2` first), and the remainder may move to other
  storage (a unique temporary), so re-assert it by the defining PCs recorded before the write.
- Dispose decompilers and close files explicitly; pass `monitor` to long operations.
- **Discover API from the local install, not memory or the web.** A Ghidra install ships
  `docs/ghidra_stubs/pypredef/` (hundreds of greppable, exact-version stub files covering
  classes the public javadoc omits, e.g. `AutoAnalysisManager`),
  `docs/GhidraAPI_javadoc.zip`, `docs/CheatSheet.html`, `docs/ChangeHistory.md`, and
  `docs/GhidraClass/` course material — of which
  `Advanced/improvingDisassemblyAndDecompilation.pdf` is the authoritative guide to most
  of Part 1. Search these with Python if your shell's text tools are proxied or unreliable.
- Ghidra writes the host filesystem with plain `open()`. Windows-hosted Ghidra driven from
  WSL: script source needs Windows paths (`C:\...`); read the same files at `/mnt/c/...`.
- **Type-check against Ghidra's INTERFACES, not its implementation classes.** A datatype
  read back from the `DataTypeManager` is a DB-backed implementation —
  `dtm.addDataType()` hands you a `FunctionDefinitionDB`, which implements
  `FunctionDefinition` but is **not** an instance of the concrete
  `FunctionDefinitionDataType` you constructed. Measured: an end-state check written
  against the impl class reported **0 of 1053** on a retype that had completely succeeded.
  Ghidra's own shipped scripts check the interface (`instanceof FunctionDefinition`) —
  follow them. Same family as the rule below: the object you get back is not the object
  you put in.
- **Compare against the API's own returned value, never a hand-written literal.** Ghidra
  names `UnsignedShortDataType` **`ushort`**, not `uint16_t`; a literal in an end-state
  check aborted a *correct* apply after its write had committed, destroying that run's
  before/after measurement. Derive the expected string from the same object you write
  (`dt.getName()`), and treat a helper's return vocabulary as API too — one classifier
  returns `x87_float`/`x87_int` where `float`/`int` were assumed, and the mismatch was
  silent.
- **`runScript(name, args)` SWALLOWS the called script's exception.** Ghidra prints
  the traceback and `runScript` returns normally, so a driver that runs sweeps in a
  loop reports every one of them as passing. Measured: a stability harness reported
  `raised: 0` while two of its nineteen sweeps had raised calibration failures, with
  both tracebacks visible in the same log. If you need the failure as a *value*, run
  the script yourself so exceptions propagate —
  `exec(compile(open(path).read(), path, "exec"), g)` with `g` seeded from the
  GhidraScript globals (`currentProgram`, `currentAddress`, `monitor`, `state`) plus
  a per-script `getScriptArgs`. A driver that cannot see the failure it exists to
  detect is this document's unfireable-check rule wearing the harness's clothes.
- **`state` is a reserved `GhidraScript` global** (the `GhidraState`). Assigning a string
  to it raises `ClassCastException` from PyGhidra's property setter, reported at a line
  far from the one that looks wrong. Others in the same namespace: `currentProgram`,
  `currentAddress`, `monitor`, `script`.
- **Never derive a path from `__file__` in a script you install.** The installed copy
  lives in Ghidra's user script directory, where `dirname(__file__)/..` resolves outside
  your repo entirely — measured: a header generator read `C:\Users\<you>\symbols`, so
  its compile check (the only step recomputing offsets from a C compiler rather than from
  the project's own arithmetic) had *never once run*. Resolve paths from a shared
  constants module.

### `getComment` and `setComment` are not mirror images

`Listing.getComment(int commentType, Address)` but `Listing.setComment(Address, int commentType,
String)`. Writing them symmetrically type-checks fine in Python and fails at the JVM boundary at
**run time** — which is to say, after whatever mutations ran before it. Measured: an apply raised
there having already written 19 struct types, leaving a half-applied program with no cascade and no
post-condition check. (Ghidra 12.x also offers `setComment(Address, CommentType, String)`; the
error message enumerates the real overloads, which is the fastest way to settle it.)

**The general rule this stands for: any API pair used read-then-write in one script is worth
checking against the actual signature, not against the other call.** Symmetry is an assumption
about the library's taste, and it is wrong often enough to cost a mutating run.


## `SymbolTable.getAllSymbols(boolean)` does not enumerate class or namespace symbols

Measured live (Ghidra 12.1.2, PyGhidra) on a program with 5,764 functions: walking
`getAllSymbols(True)` and counting by `getSymbolType()` returned **only `Function` and `Label`**
symbols — 33,757 in all, zero of type `Class` or `Namespace` — while `getNamespace("CFallMover",
None).getSymbol()` in the same run reported `type=Class source=AI address=NO ADDRESS` for a class
an earlier script had created with `createClass(None, name, SourceType.AI)`.

Two consequences for a project that counts `SourceType.AI` symbols as its mutation invariant:

- **Creating a class namespace does not move the AI-symbol count**, so an applier that budgets
  its post-check as `names applied + namespaces created` will raise on a correct apply. Budget the
  names alone and print the namespaces created beside them.
- **A ledger keyed by address never sees the class symbol** — it sits at `NO ADDRESS` and is
  never enumerated — so "every AI symbol has a ledger row, both directions" stays green across
  every class ever created that way. That is convenient, and it means the *namespaces* a project
  minted are unaudited by that gate. If their provenance matters, walk `getClassNamespaces()` or
  the namespace tree explicitly.

Written down because eleven appliers in one project had created classes this way and the
invariant had stayed green, which read as "class symbols are counted and ledgered" until a probe
asked. It was the opposite premise, and it happened to be harmless.

### The JPype boundary: two ways to read bytes wrong

*(Measured on PyGhidra 12.1.2 driving a 32-bit PE. PyGhidra is CPython + JPype; Jython is a
different runtime and most script recipes on the web are written for it.)*

- **`Memory.getBytes(Address, byte[])` with a PYTHON `bytearray` does not return the program's
  bytes, and it does not complain.** JPype converts the `bytearray` to a *fresh* Java array for
  the call, `getBytes` fills that array, and nothing is copied back. No exception, and the return
  value (the count) looks right. Measured: with a decoder's logic held constant, the `bytearray`
  form classified **all five** known `MOV r/m32, imm32` vtable-pointer stores as "not a store";
  swapping in `jpype.JArray(jpype.JByte)(n)` and reading `int(arr[i]) & 0xFF` classified all five
  correctly. Use a Java array for any out-parameter, or the `FlatProgramAPI` form
  `getBytes(Address, int)` which **returns** the array. This is the worst shape a tooling defect
  can have: a complete, plausible, wrong answer feeding a census whose value is its zeros.
- **`jarray` does not exist.** `from jarray import zeros` is Jython and raises
  `ModuleNotFoundError` under PyGhidra. Use `jpype.JArray(jpype.JByte)`. This one is loud, so it
  is the cheap half of the same confusion — but the two travel together in copied code, and a
  script carrying both fails at the import before its silently-wrong read can matter, which is
  why the silent one can survive undetected in a file that "obviously doesn't run".
- **Do not marshal bulk memory across the boundary at all.** Reading 855 KB of `.text` into a
  buffer was measured at **over 18 minutes** — the marshalling, not the searching. Use
  `Memory.findBytes` with a Java byte[] pattern (Java-side search) and marshal only the dozen
  bytes around each hit.
