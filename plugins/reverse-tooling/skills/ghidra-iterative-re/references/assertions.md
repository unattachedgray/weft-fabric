### Poisons, and making a check fire

- **Prefer checks that already fail.** Where binary ground truth contradicts current
  state, those disagreements are free demonstrations that a check fires. Cheaper and
  stronger than constructed poison.
- **A ranking rule presumes candidates of UNKNOWN mutual order; do not feed it candidates
  the chain already orders.** A nearest-base ranker scored candidates by shared slots and
  flagged a small margin as "ambiguous". Folding every export-declared ancestor of a node
  handed it the parent AND the grandparent, and the grandparent (a strict ancestor of the
  parent, sharing 4 fewer slots) was graded a competitor — five spurious ambiguity flags,
  the most valuable edge among them, each of which would have excluded the node from naming.
  Fold the nearest known ancestor only; the rest is already in the chain.
- **A selftest that derives its poison victim from the artifact inherits the artifact's
  population, and a round that legitimately empties that population breaks the test for the
  right reason.** "Pick any base-less non-anchored node" was a fine derivation until a fold
  left none (`StopIteration`). Derive victims from a property the round cannot empty, or
  guard the derivation and say what emptied it. Related: a poison that "fires" with the
  WRONG exception is not a demonstration — assert the expected message marker, or a
  `KeyError` from a missing table reads as the check working.
- **A poison that edits a row by string replacement must ASSERT it changed something, or it
  goes inert the day a producer fixes the very blank it was replacing.** Measured: a test
  flipped a registration record's `type= ` (blank) to `type=int ` to make an int-vs-float
  check fire; a later round repaired the parser that had left the cell blank, the cell now
  read `type=float`, the replace matched nothing, and the check reported "did not raise" —
  broken by a correct fix in a different round, with no test in that round reading it.
  Compare the row before and after the poison and raise if equal; and when a producer's
  output changes, run every READER's selftest (a stability harness that re-runs producers
  does not exercise the readers).
- **A DRIFT GUARD THAT NAMES THE VALUE IT EXPECTED CATCHES YOUR OWN BUG; ONE THAT COUNTS
  DOES NOT.** Measured: a census probe recovered call arguments off the wrong end of the
  push sequence (cdecl pushes right-to-left, so argument 1 is the push met FIRST walking
  back from the CALL) and reported every site as carrying a non-constant value — i.e. a
  clean, confident census of **zero** items. What refused it was a guard asserting that one
  already-known value was still present, because that guard could state what it wanted and
  what it found. A guard checking only "did we recover anything" passes the empty answer.
  **Assert a known value, not the shape of the answer** — and keep the bug in the probe's
  docstring, because it is the only thing explaining why the guard is written that way.
- **Poison where `expected` and `actual` might share a source** — the classic dead check
  is two reads of the same variable in the same loop compared to each other.
- **Never verify against state you produced this round.** The `SourceType.AI` filter
  enforces this for harvesters; apply it by hand elsewhere.
- **Never verify against an artifact measured wrong**, including its unchecked parts.
- Test verification logic against poisoned *copies of files*, never the live program.
- **Name the QUANTITY a corroboration bar applies to, and check that quantity.**
  "Two independent witnesses" for a field's *type* is not "two witnesses that the
  field is accessed" — and the loose reading passes silently while reading as the
  strict one in every report. Measured: a rule requiring two witnesses counted
  *accesses to a cell* and then took the type from however few of them carried type
  evidence, so a lone pointer-shaped access among 131 decided the cell was a pointer
  "on 90 witnesses". It was an id. Eighteen of twenty applied type upgrades failed
  the corrected bar. Whenever a bar says "N of X", write down what X is.

- **A CONTROL ARM CAN BE A SPECIFIC GROUND-TRUTH FACT INSTEAD OF A HEALTHY-LOOKING
  COUNT — and when it can, it should be.** "The matcher found 1,435 references in a
  region known to be busy" grades only *liveness*: it proves the instrument finds
  something, not that it finds the thing the probe is actually for. Prefer a control
  the probe must **reproduce exactly**, taken from a source the probe cannot
  influence. Measured: a probe whose job was to attribute a memory access to a
  *pointer* was gated on reproducing one instruction read out of the disassembly by
  hand — `MOV dword ptr [ECX + 0x1ec], 0x12`, with `ECX` reloaded from a known
  out-parameter slot four instructions earlier — as an access attributed to that
  pointer. That grades attribution, which is the claim; a reference count does not.
  Give it a poison that removes the control's subject from the population, so the
  gate is demonstrated firing.

- **AN IMPOSSIBLE RESULT IS A DEFECT, NOT A DATUM — ASSERT ON IT, DO NOT PRINT IT.**
  Where two structurally independent bounds exist, check the interval closes the
  right way and **raise** when it does not: a lower bound above an upper bound is
  not a measurement of anything, and printing it invites the reader to split the
  difference or to quote whichever end suits. Measured: a reach probe returned a
  lower bound of 624 for a base class whose derived class allocates 496 in total.
  That single check turned a plausible-looking number into a diagnosis of the
  probe's own contamination. **The best demonstrated-failing poison for such a check
  is the real defect it caught** — disable the correction and the assertion fires on
  live data, which is stronger evidence than any constructed input.

### Calibration and vacuity guards

- **Calibrate a witness by POSITIVE AGREEMENT, not only by absence of contradiction.**
  Require a new evidence source to *reproduce facts already established by other
  machinery* before it may speak about unknowns. A contradiction-only check passes
  a source that is silently misclassifying everything: measured, a classifier
  compared against the wrong vocabulary (`"float"` where the API returns
  `"x87_float"`) sent all 538 float accesses down the integer branch, and only the
  "you must reproduce the known float cells" arm caught it. Absence of disagreement
  is not agreement.
- **A vacuity guard keyed to `checked == 0` can be satisfied by the WRONG population.**
  The guard exists to catch a check with nothing to compare, and it is defeated by any
  non-empty comparison — including one drawn entirely from a *different* class than the one
  under test. Measured: a base-layout check walked the base's ancestor chain, found no rows
  for the base itself, matched 13 belonging to its grandparent, and passed. Guard the
  population you actually mean: if the entity under test is expected to contribute rows,
  require that IT contributed some, and raise naming both sets when it did not.
- **When a check re-derives what a mutator wrote, keep the two derivations SEPARATE.**
  The instinct is to share a helper so the check and the applier cannot disagree. That is
  backwards — sharing makes them agree by construction and verifies nothing. Two
  independent derivations from the same evidence, compared with a raise on disagreement, is
  a cross-check, and the duplication is the feature. Comment it as deliberate, or a later
  tidy-up will "fix" it into vacuity.
- **Prefer a PARTITION to a vote when attributing evidence, and print both buckets.**
  "Three independent registrations agree" is a count, and a count invites the question of
  how many would have been enough. The stronger form is a split of the *whole* population
  with no exceptions on either side: measured, of the 16 fields a base class's descendants
  registered, 13 sat at or above the base's end (so they are the children's own storage)
  and exactly 3 sat below it — all three the same field, in the base's only layout gap.
  Nothing else crossed the line in either direction. Two properties make that far stronger
  than the vote: it is falsifiable by a single counterexample, and **the boundary doing the
  separating was measured by an unrelated witness**, so the clean split independently
  corroborates the size it depends on. A rule that reports only what it matched cannot be
  audited — emit the other bucket and its count too.
- **A verification harness that re-runs PRODUCERS is structurally blind to MUTATORS.** The
  stability harness in this document re-runs every read-only sweep and diffs the artifacts;
  it cannot run the appliers, because running them would mutate. So a round that legitimately
  changes an artifact can orphan an applier's approved census — its hardcoded population, its
  ground-truth poison — and nothing reports it until a human next invokes that applier.
  Measured: a round took a decided-size artifact from 3 pinned entries to 7; the struct
  applier hardcoded those 3 names and gated on `apply 3`, so it refused to run at all
  (correct behaviour, invisible for exactly as long as nobody ran it), and the same change
  silently falsified the assertion in its selftest that used one of the newly-decided
  entries as its example of something to refuse. When a round changes an artifact, enumerate
  **every** consumer and say which tier each sits in; the harness covers the sweeps and
  nothing covers the appliers but you.

  **And the harness is blind a second way: to the producers it EXCUSES.** A stability harness
  earns its keep by re-running producers, so anything it merely *hashes* — for cost, for a
  cross-host dependency, for an append-only ledger — is reported `unchanged` every pass,
  truthfully, because it was never regenerated. Measured: the artifact recording **which types the
  project had applied**, derived by walking the program's own version history, was hashed-only
  because that walk is slow. Nothing re-ran it and no round did so by hand, so it covered
  boundaries up to **v55** while the program stood at **v83** — 23 boundaries missing, including
  the previous round's own type apply, in the very ledger a later round would consult to ask what
  had been applied. **Every excusal transfers ownership from the harness to a human, so it must
  carry a NAMED trigger saying when that human runs it** ("in any round that applies a type, and
  check its last recorded version against the program's"). An excusal with a reason but no trigger
  is how an artifact acquires no owner at all.
- **Give a ground-truth selftest arm a NEGATIVE twin that pins what the rule DEPENDS on.**
  An arm asserting "against the real artifacts this rule recovers exactly X and nothing
  else" proves the rule's output. It does not prove *why* the rule produced it. Add a twin
  that re-runs the same call with the one input the rule is supposed to hinge on moved, and
  require the opposite outcome — here, re-running an ownership fold with the base sized at
  the disputed cell's own offset had to fold nothing, which is what demonstrates the rule is
  bounded by the measured size rather than by the registrants it happens to agree with.
- **A contradiction needs a competing CLAIM, not merely a different string.** An
  opaque block (`uint8_t[N]`) is the *absence* of a claim about its interior, and a
  vector-typed member's components genuinely are floats — so an access disagreeing
  with either is expected, not contradictory. A conflict rule that does not model
  "no claim here" fires on correct data and trains you to widen it.
### Checks that cannot pass, and checks that cannot fire

- **A check can be UNPASSABLE as easily as unfireable — ask whether the population a
  failing gate grades can even CONTAIN the evidence that would satisfy it, because a
  check that cannot pass spends the whole time looking like a real failure.** The unfireable check is the famous one; its mirror is a
  check no run could ever satisfy, which reports a working witness as broken and sends
  you to debug the witness. Measured: a calibration required a pointer-detecting route to
  fire on a cell some *other* route had independently proved is a pointer. In the tool's
  narrow mode the one comparable cell existed, but every access to it came from function
  bodies that mode's own population rule excluded — so the satisfying evidence was
  unreachable by construction, and the same code passed 56-of-121 in wide mode. Two habits
  fall out, both cheap:
  - **Make a failing gate NAME both populations it compared.** "Never overlapped" and
    "disjoint by construction" are the same message and completely different findings;
    printing the two sets turned a day of suspecting the route into one read.
  - **Before believing a gate that says a witness is broken, ask whether the population
    it grades can CONTAIN the satisfying evidence.** If it cannot, the honest outcome is
    to scope the check to where it can speak — and to *assert the exclusion*, so it
    retires itself when the population changes, rather than outliving its reason.
  Do not fix such a check by enlarging the evidence it grades: widening the narrow mode's
  population would have made it pass, and would have changed the population of the route
  that produced an already-applied type.
- **A COUNT-BASED witness bar can be unsatisfiable by the SHAPE of the evidence, not by the
  population — and then it parks a settled fact forever while looking like healthy caution.**
  The bar above was a population problem; this one is about what the evidence *is*. Measured: a
  layout sweep parked any cell whose type was carried by fewer than two distinct function
  bodies — a good rule, because a cell touched by 90 bodies where exactly one carries a provable
  type is a one-witness claim in a 90-witness costume. But the cell in question is written by a
  SETTER: ten instructions storing the two parameters an exported, mangled signature *declares*
  into two members. **A setter is written once by construction**, so no second body can ever
  exist, and the cell parked across three rounds while the answer sat in the export's own name.
  The bar was counting the wrong thing: its purpose is to stop ONE BODY'S INFERENCE being
  believed, and a binary-DECLARED parameter type is not an inference at all. The fix is a TIER
  test, not a bigger count.
  - **Ask of every threshold: can the evidence shape it grades ever produce the number?** A
    constructor, a setter, a registrar entry, a vtable slot and a static initialiser are all
    written exactly once; any bar of two over *bodies* is unsatisfiable for all of them.
  - **The failure is silent and flattering** — the artifact says `candidate`, which reads as
    "not enough evidence yet" when it means "this bar cannot be met here." Have the note say
    which, as the sweep above eventually did: *"type T is carried by only 1 body of N"* is
    actionable where *"multiple provable types"* is not.
- **A check with two modes must be demonstrated in BOTH, or the mode you skipped stops
  being reproducible in silence.** The calibration above was added by a round that ran
  only the wide mode, quoted wide numbers in its commit message, and regenerated only the
  wide artifacts. The narrow mode was not re-run for four commits; its committed artifacts
  quietly stopped matching its own code, and the check had *never executed there at all*
  until an unrelated stability harness ran it. Whenever a round touches a code path shared
  by two configurations, run both before committing.
- **A check that lives inside an `if not SELFTEST:` block is not covered by the selftest,
  whatever the selftest's count says.** Three calibrations sat outside the poisonable
  function, so a confident "4/4 demonstrated firing" described the other four and nothing
  warned. Extract a check into a function taking its inputs **and its mode flag** as
  parameters — the flag is what lets one mode demonstrate the other's branch, and in this
  case the narrow mode's real rows demonstrated the wide branch's raise with no poison at
  all.
- **A witness written before an apply must be RE-VALIDATED after it.** The decompiler's
  output is an *input* to most witnesses, and your own struct and type applies change it —
  so a witness can be invalidated by a round that never touched it. Measured: a destructor
  stride extractor deliberately excluded a constant it kept meeting as an *addend*; typing
  an embedded member array turned that same constant into a real `PTRADD` **multiplier**,
  which walked straight past the exclusion and made the measurement ambiguous. Nothing
  failed at the time. It surfaced two rounds later as a gate firing on unrelated work, and
  looked exactly like damage from the round in progress. The exclusion was not defeated by
  new data — it was defeated by the *category* of the data changing underneath it.
- **WHICH ARM OF A SHIPPED HELPER MUTATES IS NOT IN THE JAVADOC, AND AN INHERITED CAVEAT CAN
  NAME THE WRONG ONE — READ THE SOURCE, THEN BRACKET THE READING.** Measured on
  `FillOutStructureHelper`: a handoff warned that `createNewStructure=True` mutates the
  DataTypeManager. It is **backwards** — that arm builds a detached `StructureDataType` and never
  adds it, while the two arms nobody was warned about are the dangerous ones (one rewrites the
  existing struct you meant to cross-check; the other calls `createClass` and `RenameLabelCmd` at
  **`SourceType.USER_DEFINED`**, laundering into the highest tier from inside a helper that reads
  as an analysis convenience). Per-arm mechanics live in `references/api.md`, "Read-only
  witnesses"; the generalisation is what belongs here: **the source read is a hypothesis about
  your install, and a datatype/function-count diff across the run that RAISES is what makes it
  evidence.** Neither half is optional — reading alone gets the arm wrong when the source is
  subtle, and bracketing alone tells you nothing until you have already run it.
### Pricing reach and independence

- **A REACH FIGURE CAN BE STRUCTURALLY MEANINGLESS AND STILL READ AS TOTAL COVERAGE — price the
  mechanism's PRECONDITION, not the availability of a target.** Measured while pricing that
  helper: all **198 of 198** laid-out classes had a recorded constructor site to point it at,
  which reads as complete coverage, and it produced cells for **1 of 12** sampled. The
  precondition is a locatable receiver, and **173 of those 198 recorded sites are not member
  functions at all** — they are the FACTORIES the constructor was inlined into, correctly carrying
  `__cdecl`, in which ECX is not an input, so there is no mapped symbol for `this`. One
  calling-convention census over the whole population costs seconds. Ask "does the precondition
  hold here", never "can I name a target here".
- **BUT PRICE THE PRECONDITION OVER EVERY ENTRY POINT, NOT OVER THE ONE YOUR ARTIFACT HAPPENED TO
  RECORD — THAT IS WHERE THE FACTOR OF TWELVE WAS.** The same round then priced the whole thing at
  **25 of 198** reachable and **12** independently useful, and both figures were wrong, because it
  tried exactly ONE function per class: the address its size artifact stored. The mechanism's real
  requirement is *a member function with a receiver*, and **every non-static member takes `this`**
  — a method touching many fields is a better witness than a constructor setting four. Widening
  from "the recorded constructor" to "any member" took reach to **198 of 198** and the independent
  population from 12 to **151**. Two riders, both measured:
  - **Enumerate a class's whole function population before pricing any per-class witness.** This
    document already warns that *a class's vtable is not its population — it is only the virtual
    half*; here the mirror failed, a witness built from the constructor alone, and the vtable route
    reached **109 of the 173** by itself. Namespace members reached 64, exported `??0` constructor
    manglings **0**. Report the union.
  - **A VTABLE SLOT TARGET IS NOT NECESSARILY THAT CLASS'S METHOD, AND THE CHECK IS FREE.** Slots
    are shared through inheritance — a derived table repeats its base's entries for every method it
    does not override — so a target reached from C may be a BASE's method whose `this` is the base,
    and attributing its field accesses to C is an ownership error. No hierarchy artifact is needed:
    **a target appearing in more than one attributed table is shared by construction.** Measured
    **560 of 1322 shared**, and the arm that mattered: **0 classes reachable only through a shared
    target**. Had that been non-zero, the reach figure would have been an upper bound pending an
    ownership rule.
- **CROSS-TAB REACH AGAINST INDEPENDENCE BEFORE PRICING A CORROBORATION ROUND — the number you
  want is the INTERSECTION, and it is smaller than either.** A second-witness round is worth what
  it can reach *and* speak about non-circularly. A decompiler-derived witness inherits the types
  you applied, so a class you have already typed may hand your own layout back; a class with no
  type cannot. Measured, on the first pass: 25 reachable, 151 untyped, and the cell that decides
  the round — reachable **and** untyped — was **12**. (The reach half was later corrected to 198,
  taking the cell to **151** — see the entry-point rule above. The cross-tab was the right frame;
  one of its inputs was wrong.) Scoping on 198, on 151 or on 25 would each have been
  scoping on a number that does not exist. **And demonstrate the witness on the independent half**:
  the first sample's one working class was typed (persuasive, worth nothing); re-sampling reached
  an untyped class that reproduced **20 of 20** committed field offsets with 0 straddles, and that
  single case is the whole proof-of-concept.
- **A COUNT MATCH BETWEEN TWO PARTITIONS IS A PROMPT TO JOIN THEM, AND THE APPROVAL CENSUS IS THE
  LAST CHANCE TO REFUTE THE ROUND — SO WRITE IT TO BE CAPABLE OF SAYING NO.** Measured, on the very
  next round: those 173 `__cdecl` bodies were written up as *wrong prototypes an analyzer had
  committed*, and a mutating repair round was recommended and approved. The census that was
  supposed to produce its population instead refuted it. The size artifact carried a `route=`
  column — in the same cell the earlier round had parsed the address out of — splitting the same
  198 classes **173 / 25**, identically to the convention split. Joined **per class by address**
  rather than by total: **0 off-diagonal**. They are the same partition. `factory_inline` means
  the constructor was inlined into a factory, so the recorded site is a factory — not a member
  function, no receiver, and **`__cdecl` is correct for it**. Four things generalise:
  - **An identical total on two partitions is evidence of nothing until you join by address.** A
    total can match by coincidence; a ranked decomposition cannot.
  - **Read every column of the row you generalised from.** The refuting evidence was not missing;
    it sat beside the value already being read, and the defect was an unstated assumption (*every
    `ctor_write_max` site is a constructor*) the artifact itself contradicts.
  - **"Not an X" needs positive evidence, not the absence of X's marker.** The confirming arms —
    **173 of 173 return a pointer, 0 of 173 read ECX before writing it**, from raw instruction
    p-code — with the control that makes the zero a measurement: **25 of 25** genuine member
    functions in the same population *do* read ECX first.
  - **A round whose damage no existing gate can see must be refuted BEFORE the apply.** Setting a
    calling convention moves no function count and creates no symbol, so the function-count
    invariant and the AI ledger would both have stayed green while 173 correct functions acquired
    a wrong `AI`-tier prototype under a headline reading *"173 prototypes repaired"*.
- **BEFORE HAND-ROLLING AN ALIAS TRACKER, CHECK `FillOutStructureHelper` — IT IS THE SAME
  WITNESS, ON SSA, AND IT RECURSES INTO CALLS.** A linear register tracker over raw instructions
  is the natural way to answer *"which offsets does this body touch through `this`"*, and it is
  what projects write: it can only LOSE registers, it stops at basic-block joins, and it stops
  dead at a `CALL`. Ghidra ships the same question answered over decompiler SSA —
  `ghidra.app.decompiler.util.FillOutStructureHelper.processStructure(highVar, func, ...)`, then
  **`getStorePcodeOps()` / `getLoadPcodeOps()`**, each a list of `OffsetPcodeOpPair`
  (`getOffset()` / `getPcodeOp()`), plus `getComponentMap()` → `NoisyStructureBuilder`. Because
  `HighFunction` p-code is SSA with `MULTIEQUAL` phis it crosses basic blocks by construction,
  and with a non-null `decomplib` it follows CALLs. Measured on one project: its hand-rolled
  scanner reached a median of 4 construction bodies per class only because the ROUND explicitly
  walked the call chain itself, and its own docstring conceded the tracker "can only lose
  registers".

  Three cautions, and they are why this is a check rather than a recommendation:
  - **It is decompiler-derived**, so it inherits every signature you have applied — the exact
    circularity this document's trust model exists to prevent. It is a second witness, not a
    replacement for an instruction-level one, and the two disagreeing is a finding.
  - **`createNewStructure=True` MUTATES the DataTypeManager.** Use it as an evidence producer:
    take `getStorePcodeOps()` and discard the returned `Structure`.
  - **The returned ops are not confined to the function you passed.** Ghidra's own caller filters
    them (`RecoveredClassHelper.runFillOutStructureHelper` calls
    `removePcodeOpsNotInFunction(function, stores)`), and a harvester that skips that step
    attributes another function's accesses to this one.
- **Scope a candidate pool to the smallest structure the rule is actually about.** That
  same extractor pooled candidates across the whole FUNCTION when the ABI contract it
  encodes (an array walk with its count at `[ptr-4]`) is a property of a **loop**. Pooling
  one level too coarse was correct only for as long as every one of these functions happened
  to contain a single loop — i.e. it was luck, indistinguishable from design, until an apply
  added a second loop.
### What an apply invalidates

- **A calibration anchored on a LIVE defect becomes unfireable the moment the defect is
  repaired.** Measured: two detectors calibrated by firing on real bodies (an `ftol` whose x87
  input was lost; a vtable slot under-stating cleanup) both failed their own self-tests the day
  the repair landed — correctly, because no body left in the program showed either defect. The
  tempting fix, relaxing the arm, would have left a detector nothing tests. **Pin a VERBATIM
  fixture of the pre-repair shape, with its provenance (program version, address), and keep a
  live NEGATIVE arm on the repaired record.** A detector's calibration has to outlive the defect
  it was built to find, or the next regression of that defect meets an untested detector.
- **A decided-artifact RENAME can disable the witness that corroborated it — whenever
  you rename a component, a field or a type, ask which witnesses match on that spelling
  and re-run them in the same round.** The worst version of "re-validate a witness after
  an apply", because it looks like bookkeeping rather than evidence. Measured: a value type's component was renamed
  `w` → `Layer` on the strength of a registration witness that matches *registered
  suffix names against the type's component names*. The rename broke that match, so
  the route silently stopped deciding — and the artifact it had produced stayed in
  the repo, now underivable, for **sixteen program versions**. The apply that
  invalidated the evidence was the one the evidence had justified. Two follow-ups
  measured when that one was repaired, both of which outlive the rename:
  - **The rename was not what hid it — the SILENCE was.** A witness that abstains
    per-item needs a guard separating a *legitimate* abstention from a broken
    route, or the two print the same line forever. Here a genuinely partial
    registration (one component, nothing to decide) and a complete four-component
    one that failed to match were reported identically, which is what bought the
    defect sixteen versions. This is the unfireable-check rule one level down: not
    "the witness produced no rows" but "the witness declined *this* row", and the
    fix is the same shape — enumerate why. Derive the guard's threshold from the
    constants (the known types' component counts), never a literal, or the next
    type added leaves the guard behind.
  - **A correspondence you DECLARED is not a match you measured.** The broken route
    had bridged the two spellings with a hand-written alias; the repaired one
    matches literally, but only because the component now carries the
    registration's own name. Either way the name tests nothing — count, offsets and
    kinds are what discriminate the types. Write that down where the comparison
    lives, or a later reader banks the string equality as a second witness. Same
    family as the disambiguator rule below: the tautology is invisible because
    every report still describes it as agreement.
  - **Repair at the narrowest scope that fixes it.** The tempting fix was to drop
    name matching altogether, making the route rename-proof forever — and it
    decided exactly the same rows, i.e. bought a broader fire population for no
    measured gain. Robustness belongs in the guard, not in a loosened rule; a
    widened rule is a decided-artifact change wearing a bugfix's clothes.
- **A structural fold that replaces N evidence-bearing cells with ONE composite orphans
  every check and row keyed to the old cells — and none of them fails; they go INERT.**
  Folding a 67-cell block into one embedded-record component silently orphaned two
  decided per-cell type upgrades, one must-fire pin, two test poisons, and one
  serialisation cross-check across three consumers. The pattern that caught the tail: a
  raise IN THE MACHINERY for any orphaned key (an upgrade keyed inside a group), pins
  re-scoped with the retirement recorded, poisons rebuilt with assert-it-changed guards,
  and the shared descent extracted on its third consumer. Grep for the old keys before
  the fold, not after the third silent miss.
- **The selective-revert rule binds automation too.** A stability harness classifies
  version restamps against the on-disk working copy; a helper loop that then blanket-
  reverts every restamped file to VCS state wipes the round's own uncommitted regenerated
  artifacts — the exact blanket revert the rule forbids, executed by a script instead of
  a hand. Give the loop an explicit set of the round's own files, by name.
- **THE ANTI-CIRCULARITY AUDIT MUST BE RUN OVER THE WHOLE LEDGER, NOT PER ROUND.** Discharged
  against "the names this round applied", it can only ever catch a leak the round happened to
  disturb — which is why one project found its only such leak in the round that named the
  highest-fan-in function in the binary, and in no earlier round. Run it once over every
  applied name against every cell of every committed artifact. Four things decide whether the
  answer means anything:
  - **Join on the UNQUALIFIED names too.** Measured: only 677 of 3596 applied addresses
    carried a namespace, so a qualified-only audit reaches under a fifth of the population —
    and the one real leak was an unqualified allocator name.
  - **Excuse by (artifact, COLUMN), never by artifact.** A file that legitimately carries an
    applied name in one column would otherwise get a blanket pass for its other fifteen.
  - **A join by name cannot tell YOUR SYMBOL from the BINARY STRING your symbol came from.**
    Measured: ten flagged cells were all a self-announce literal in `.rdata` — the very
    evidence the applied name was derived from, so equality is the expected direction. Ask of
    every match: *would this cell hold this value if we had applied nothing?* A false positive
    on a provenance gate is worse than noise; it gets explained away once and ignored after.
  - **Turn each excusal into a MEASUREMENT the producer can fail.** Where the excused column
    carries an applied name, require the producer's own name column to be SUPPRESSED on the
    same rows; where the artifact's subject is provenance, require it to LABEL those cells as
    yours from its own source column. Both were demonstrated failing on poisoned copies.
  And **print what the audit cannot see, as a number**: a ledger join is blind to a
  project-derived name applied at a HIGHER tier, as are every other ledger-based gate. That is
  not a hole in the audit — it is the reason the tier discipline exists.

- **AN ARM WHOSE SUBJECT IS THE ROUND'S OWN UNAPPLIED WORK FAILS THE DAY THAT WORK LANDS.** A
  census tool gained a ground-truth arm reading *"the live census decides rows and calibrates above
  its floor"*. The round then applied all 79 decidable rows and the arm failed — correctly by its
  own wording, uselessly in fact, because "nothing left to decide" is the round SUCCEEDING. This is
  the converse of the familiar trap (*a calibration pinned to a defect stops firing the day the
  defect is fixed*) and it costs more, because it fails loudly inside the expensive tail instead of
  going quiet. The repair is a POSITIVE CONTROL that manufactures its own subject: mutate the tool's
  definition of "undecided" for one run — here, treat `int` as undefined — and require that every row
  which then becomes decidable carries its donor, that donor's mangled name and a resolved type. It
  exercises the whole decision path, needs no unapplied work to exist, and cannot rot as the
  population empties. **Before pinning an arm to live data, ask what it will read once this round has
  done what it set out to do.**
### The stability harness

- **Run every read-only sweep after every apply and require byte-identical output.**
  This is the only cheap defence against the whole class above, because it does not
  depend on predicting which witness a given apply perturbs. Build it as a driver
  over the sweeps whose artifacts you commit, and:
  - **print the exclusions with their reasons on every run** — a silent exclusion
    reads as coverage, and the harness's reach has to be a stated number;
  - **classify benign churn separately.** Most sweeps stamp rows with the program
    version they harvested at, so a re-run rewrites that column and nothing else. On
    one project 14 undifferentiated "CHANGED" files resolved into **19 restamps and 7
    real changes**; a gate that noisy stops being read. Classify, list, never drop;
  - **do not auto-restore what it overwrites.** Sweeps write before their own final
    checks, so a differing run leaves plausible files on disk. Reverting them is a
    deliberate act (`git checkout`), not a side effect that hides the finding;
  - **and when you do revert, revert SELECTIVELY.** The driver regenerates every
    artifact, so running it to *verify a repair* leaves the repaired files sitting
    next to two dozen incidental restamps — and the blanket `git checkout --` the
    gate's own message suggests will wipe the round's work along with the noise.
    Keep the round's files by name, revert the rest.

  Run it *today*, not only after the next apply: any sweep whose current output
  differs from its committed artifact is a perturbation that already happened and
  nobody noticed. Read the artifact's own `program_version` before predicting what
  a re-derivation should produce: "it will return to the committed value" is only
  valid if the committed file was stamped at the *current* version, and a
  prediction that quietly assumes otherwise fails for reasons that look exactly
  like damage from the round in progress.
- **A disambiguator for a witness may NOT consult the quantity that witness corroborates.**
  When two candidates survive, picking the one that matches the already-decided value is
  trivially available and usually right — and it silently converts an independent
  measurement into a tautology, while every report still describes it as two agreeing
  witnesses. Disambiguate on structure the other witness knows nothing about, or report
  nothing.
- **An approved census is a RULE plus a number — record the predicate beside the count,
  or the approval is unreproducible.** The number a human approves is the output of a
  measuring rule, and the rule is the part a later implementer actually needs: measured,
  a handoff recorded "44 approved" and the operation to perform, but the census's
  concept-join bar lived only in a design exploration's chat report — the re-implementation
  derived the population the way the existing machinery always had and fired **100**. The
  population-drift gate (raise if the fired count differs from the approved one) turned
  that into a refused dry run rather than a wrong apply; the bar was then recovered from
  the archived exploration report. Two halves, both cheap: commit the predicate (or the
  census artifact itself) in the same change that records the approval, and when a lost
  rule must be reconstructed, require the reconstruction to reproduce the approved number
  per stratum, not merely in total — a total can match by coincidence; a ranked
  decomposition cannot.
### Counts, literals and approved censuses

- **An expected COUNT must be derived from the artifact, never written as a literal.**
  A hardcoded population size is correct on the day it is typed and silently wrong
  forever after, and because it usually lives in a *summary line* rather than an
  assertion, nothing fails — the round just reports a denominator from an earlier era
  of the project. Two instances here: a test asserting "3 upgrades applied" that went
  stale when a fourth route added rows, and a sweep reporting "198 of **289**
  unanchored tables" that kept saying 289 after 7 of those tables were merged out of
  existence. Compute it (`len(tables) - len(anchors)`), and treat a literal in a
  report as the same defect as a literal in a check.
  - **The worst place for such a literal is a GATE'S DOCUMENTED EXPECTED OUTPUT, and the
    round that invalidates it will fix only the clause it came for.** A checklist recording
    what each gate must print when it passes is prose: nothing executes it, so nothing can
    fail. Measured: a round moved 22 names into a provenance ledger, which changed **six**
    numbers in one audit's documented headline — and that round corrected exactly **one**,
    the number it was *about*, leaving five stale in the same paragraph, among them a
    closing sentence still asserting the very quantity the round had reduced to zero. They
    survived until an unrelated round happened to run the gate and read its real output.
    Wrong code fails loudly; a wrong expected value teaches the next reader a false number
    and is then believed. **When a round changes what a gate PRINTS, re-derive that gate's
    entire documented paragraph from a fresh run — not the sentence you noticed.**
- **When a gate fires during a round, ISOLATE before attributing it to your change.**
  The reflex is to assume the work in progress broke it, and that reflex is expensive
  in both directions: it can send you rewriting something correct, or — worse — get
  the failure quietly written off as "expected fallout from this round" and dropped.
  Re-run the same check against the **pre-change state**. Here a size sweep raised on
  a class's ambiguous destructor stride in the middle of an unrelated amendment;
  re-running it against the pre-round artifact produced byte-identical output
  including the same raise, which exonerated the round in one step and converted the
  failure into a separate, honestly-recorded open item. The control run is usually
  minutes, and it is the difference between a finding and a guess.
- **Diff against a state the failure could not have produced.** The regeneration diff is
  the workhorse verification in this document, and it has a blind spot: if you revert an
  artifact and then re-run the producer, "unchanged" is *also* what you get when the
  producer crashes and writes nothing. Pass state and failure state become identical —
  the unfireable-check shape wearing a workflow's clothes. Measured, and published as a
  false green before it was caught: a sweep died on a `TypeError` in a newly added gate,
  wrote nothing, and the byte comparison against the just-restored file reported a perfect
  match. Two habits close it, and you want both: **read the run's exit status before you
  read its output** (with an async job runner this is not optional — a task id is not a
  result), and **assert the write actually happened** — row count, mtime, a line the
  producer only prints on success — before trusting any comparison.
### Files, encodings and hosts

- **Never byte-compare a tool-written file against your VCS's stored copy.** Ghidra writes
  CRLF on Windows and git normalizes to LF on commit, so `git show HEAD:file` versus the
  working file differs by exactly one byte per line — on every file, regardless of
  content. It looks like a real diff and it is pure line-ending policy. Compare parsed
  content, or normalize first; a harness that compares on-disk before/after is immune and
  is the better design for this reason alone.
- **A WRITER THAT DOES NOT NAME ITS ENCODING PRODUCES DIFFERENT BYTES DEPENDING ON WHICH HOST
  RAN IT — AND THE FAILURE LANDS IN YOUR GUARD RAIL, NOT IN AN ARTIFACT.** The CRLF rule above
  is the famous half of this; the encoding half is quieter and worse. Measured: a shared
  `append_csv` helper opened its file with no `encoding=`, so it wrote **cp1252 when called from
  Windows-hosted Ghidra and UTF-8 when called from a Linux-side script**. A `§` in one round's
  provenance strings became a bare `0xA7`, and a standing Linux-side audit died with
  `UnicodeDecodeError` **reading the very ledger it exists to check** — so the symptom was "the
  gate is broken", not "the data is wrong", which is the reading that wastes an hour. What
  proved it was the helper rather than the round: **four artifacts already carried the same
  character as `0xC2 0xA7`, valid UTF-8**, written by the other host. Name the encoding in
  shared writers; until then, keep everything an applier writes to a ledger ASCII. Any project
  driving Windows-hosted Ghidra from WSL or a container has both halves of this.
- **A LOWER BOUND ON A CLASS SIZE IS INHERITED; A CONSTRUCTOR'S OWN WRITE EXTENT IS ONLY THE
  ANSWER FOR A ROOT.** Obvious stated plainly, and easy to get wrong in code because the witness
  is per-body. Measured: a derived class whose constructor writes nothing but the vptr and a
  class-identity tag has an own `write_max` of **8**, while it cannot be smaller than the base it
  contains — whose constructor reaches **452**. A producer that took each class's own writes
  reported `8` and thereby contradicted a finding the project had already written down in prose.
  Walk the chain (`max(own, base's lower)`), take the UPPER bound from the smallest **transitive**
  descendant that is actually allocated rather than from direct children only, and assert
  containment both ways so a single row can falsify it. And the thing that caught it: **when a
  new artifact replaces prose, diff it against the prose** — the disagreement is the check.
- **A GUARD WRITTEN AGAINST SELF-HARVEST CAN REFUTE THE EVIDENCE RULE ITSELF, NOT JUST THE
  PLUMBING — SO READ WHAT IT SAYS BEFORE RELAXING IT.** A producer required every class name it
  emitted to be attested in the binary's export manglings, on the narrow grounds that a recent
  naming round had applied those same strings to those same addresses. It refused to run — and
  the refusal was not about a read-back at all: it showed that the round which first attributed
  those classes had leaned on *"the factory's NAME declares what it builds"*, while the factory
  manglings actually name their **input** (`CreateFriendlyUnit` takes a `CBasicUnit *`;
  `CreateProject` names the *unit* type, not the project type). The attribution had been resting
  on the English of a member name the whole time. **Emit the NAME and the ATTRIBUTION as separate
  columns at separate tiers**, cite the mangling that genuinely declares the type, and let the
  guard check only the half it can verify.
- **FIXING THE WRITE SIDE OF A ROUND-TRIP WITHOUT THE READ SIDE TURNS AN ACCIDENTAL PASS INTO
  REAL CORRUPTION.** The encoding rule above tells you to name the encoding; this is the trap
  waiting when you do. A bare read and a bare write on the SAME host cancel out — cp1252 decodes
  `0xC2 0xA7` to `Â§` and re-encodes it back — so a file round-trips byte-identically **by
  accident**, and nothing has ever looked wrong. Name the encoding on the WRITE only, and that
  `Â§` is emitted as `0xC3 0x82 0xC2 0xA7`: a file that was correct is now double-encoded, *by
  the change made to fix encoding*. Measured on the first producer run after a writer-only fix
  (non-ASCII `[167,194]` → `[130,167,194,195]`), caught because the check counted the specific
  bytes rather than diffing. **Trace the whole path a value travels — which reader put it in
  memory, which writer puts it back — and change every hop or none.** And note where the
  evidence came from: a byte census, because the naive `git show HEAD:file` diff was drowned in
  CRLF-vs-LF noise, exactly as this document warns two rules up.
- **WRITE THE ENVIRONMENT PROBE TO RUN UNDER BOTH INTERPRETERS, AND RUN IT IN BOTH PLACES
  BEFORE BUILDING ON A ONE-SAMPLE INFERENCE.** A cross-host project has two Pythons with
  different defaults, and a single observed byte is enough to *deduce* which — but not enough to
  find the other direction. Measured: the deduction "Ghidra writes cp1252" was correct, and the
  probe that confirmed it also found the half nobody had looked for, that the reverse direction
  is **silent** rather than raising. Make the probe touch no host-specific API so the comparison
  is one command in each place; it costs minutes and it is the difference between fixing a
  one-directional bug and a two-directional one.
### Reading a gate that fired

- **APPLYING NAMES TO A POPULATION A HARVESTER READS IS THE CHEAPEST AUDIT OF THAT HARVESTER'S
  FILTER — AND THE PASSING DIRECTION IS THE ONE WORTH CITING.** The trust-model reference
  (`references/trust-and-circularity.md`) already says a wide naming round finds filter
  holes, because that is how the only leak on one project was found. The mirror is worth stating separately, because it looks like churn and gets reverted:
  measured, naming 16 vtable slot targets made the project's OLDEST sweep — the one that had
  once folded 578 agent-applied names back into committed evidence — move 12 `primary_name`
  cells from the default `FUN_…` spelling to **blank**. It met sixteen freshly applied names and
  emitted none of them. **That artifact diff is the anti-circularity filter demonstrating itself
  on live data; keep it and cite it rather than reverting it as noise**, because otherwise the
  filter goes unwatched from the round that installed it onward. It also tells you the two
  producers disagree about how to render "no non-agent name" (one blanks, one falls back to the
  default spelling) — harmless, and worth knowing before you join on that column.
- **A verification pass is not a checkpoint — a harness must not pollute the evidence it
  grades.** One sweep here appended ten metrics rows every time it ran, so each pass of
  the stability driver wrote ten rows of non-history (hundreds accumulated, all identical
  in shape). Snapshot-and-restore the append-only files, and *print* that you did, so the
  restore is visible rather than a silent side effect.
- **A FALSE POSITIVE on a gate is worse than noise.** Noise gets skimmed; a false positive
  gets *reasoned about*, and then discounted — which trains the reader to discount exactly
  the entries the gate exists to raise. Measured: a stability harness classified benign
  version restamps by splitting CSV rows on `,` instead of parsing them, so any row with a
  comma inside a quoted field kept its version cell and its file was reported as a
  perturbed witness. It fired on three artifacts immediately after a large type apply —
  indistinguishable from the exact damage the harness exists to catch — and all three were
  pure restamps. **Parse the format; never split it.** A classifier that separates benign
  churn from real change is load-bearing, so it deserves the same rigor as the check it
  feeds.

  **And the worst false positive of all sits on a DISAGREEMENT report.** Measured: a probe
  comparing a property registrar's field names against the names already on the recovered
  structs reported **18 CONFLICTs** — "two sources disagree about this field" — and every one
  was an agreement seen at the wrong granularity. The registrar names `Pos.X`, `Pos.Y`,
  `Pos.Z` at three consecutive offsets; the program has ONE 16-byte component called `Pos`
  covering all three. A string comparison calls that a conflict. **Compare names at the
  granularity each source actually speaks in** — a dotted name is a sub-field of a record,
  not a competing claim about the same cell — and note the asymmetry that earns this its own
  rule: ordinary noise gets skimmed, but a conflict gets *reasoned about* and then explained
  away, which is how a reader learns to discount the conflicts that are real.
- **A confinement predicate cannot see an INTERPROCEDURAL dependency, and a stray is not
  automatically damage.** The usual predicate — signature ∪ local-variable types ∪
  referenced typed globals — misses a function that merely *calls* something returning a
  typed pointer and then dispatches through it: the typed locals in its decompilation are
  decompiler-invented, not committed variables, so no route sees them. Measured: the single
  control stray after a vftable retype was a real, intended effect arriving exactly that
  way. Adjudicate a stray by **reading the function**, and record the predicate's blind
  spot — widening the control group to make the number look better is backwards, and is the
  temptation this rule exists to name.
- **A run that RAISED must not have its output promoted.** Scripts commonly write
  their artifacts before the final verification stage, so a failing run can leave
  perfectly plausible files on disk — already regenerated, already looking current,
  and now disagreeing with the last verified state for reasons nobody recorded. After
  any raise, diff the artifacts and revert the ones that run touched. This is the
  same shape as the apply whose post-write check crashed: the write survives the
  failure, so the failure has to be treated as reaching the *files*, not just the
  exit status.
- **THE SAME VALUE CAN COME BACK BY A DIFFERENT AND SOUND ROUTE, AND A VALUE-BASED ASSERTION
  CANNOT TELL.** Measured: an arm asserted that a particular field offset must NOT appear in the
  harvested evidence, because its earlier appearance had been an artifact of a stack-tracking bug
  since fixed. The offset returned, and the arm failed for several rounds. Adjudicated, it was
  **real**: supplied by a function whose own export mangling declares the type of the parameter
  being read, from the same body that supplies every other offset the check requires to be
  PRESENT. The arm had conflated *"this value must not appear"* with *"this value must not appear
  FOR THAT REASON"*, and only the second was ever the point. **Assert the PROVENANCE, not the
  number** — the repair replaced one value check with three that name the contributing body and
  instruction, plus a negative twin scoped to the artifact's original route, which still fails if
  the bug returns while the value is legitimately present. Note also which way this failed: the
  stale check made a correct harvester look broken, and the tempting "fix" was to go and debug
  the harvester.
- **A PATTERN THAT WAS A BUG LAST ROUND IS NOT EVIDENCE OF A BUG THIS ROUND.** The failing
  instruction above was `TEST byte ptr [EBX],0x8` — reading operand 0, which the immediately
  preceding round had just proved was being mistaken for a WRITE elsewhere in the same codebase.
  It is not the same bug: that consumer scans EVERY operand and names its rows `..._access`,
  which is direction-neutral by construction and correct, because a read of `ptr+K` proves the
  cell lies inside the pointee exactly as a write does. **The identical instruction shape was a
  defect in one consumer and correct behaviour in another.** Adjudicate each consumer against
  what it CLAIMS, not against the shape that burned you last time — pattern-matching a fresh
  finding onto a recent one is how a correct component gets "repaired".
- **A PARTING SPECULATION IN A COMMITTED ROUND RECORD IS INHERITED AS A FINDING — TEST IT, THEN
  STRIKE IT WHERE A READER MEETS IT.** That preceding round closed by predicting the same defect
  in three more consumers. All three were wrong: two scan every operand, one reads the source
  operand deliberately, and the affected consumer was the only one. Notes are read as evidence by
  whoever comes next, so the refutation was written back into the original section rather than
  left to a later reader to discover — the same discipline as retracting a measured zero in place.
- **A check that fires may be a defect in the CHECK.** Validating a decided artifact
  with a *stronger* predicate than the calibrated rule that produced it rejects rows
  the producing sweep legitimately attributed. Before loosening a rule or editing
  data, ask which predicate the artifact was derived under — this is the mirror of
  "a calibration population must share the fire population's code shape."

---

### A tool property your design rests on is a standing gate, not a one-off check

**Measured.** A round represented 19 derived classes as `struct Derived { Base base; }` — a *typed*
member rather than a flattened copy — specifically so they would track their base and could not
drift. The whole argument rests on one property: **that Ghidra propagates a length change through a
typed member.** That is a property of *the tool*, not of the binary, so a version upgrade could
remove it and nothing else in the project would notice: the structs would still exist, still have
the right length today, and silently stop tracking.

So it is measured, and the measurement is **driven on every canary pass**, not once at design time.

Two things make it a real check rather than a ceremony:

- **Run it where it cannot touch the program.** A `StandAloneDataTypeManager` is a real
  `DataTypeManager` with no program behind it, so throwaway types can be built, grown and read back
  with zero blast radius. Bracket it anyway — assert the *program's* type count is unmoved either
  side, because "this cannot have touched anything" is the reasoning this discipline refuses
  everywhere else.
- **Give it a negative control, or it proves nothing.** Alongside the typed member, build the
  design you are *rejecting* — here an opaque `byte[N]` copy of the same base — and require that it
  does **not** follow. A run where both appear to track is measuring something other than
  propagation, and without the control it reads as a pass. The control also produced a finding of
  its own: the project's 13 existing opaque-copy structs are drift-**invisible**, not drift-free.

**Generalise:** whenever a design's safety argument reduces to "the tool does X", write the
smallest experiment that would fail if the tool stopped doing X, pair it with a control that must
fail, and put it in the recurring gate set. Design premises decay silently; program facts get
re-derived every round.

## Checking a delegated batch: the three checks that are not about the evidence

When work is delegated in a fixed schema — a batch of proposed names, types or layouts, each with
citations a probe can re-verify — the obvious check is *do the citations hold against the program?*
That check is necessary and it is not close to sufficient. Measured on a 104-row batch where **every
citation in every row it flagged verified perfectly**:

**1. Pre-flight, before the apply, not after.** The citation verifier normally runs over committed
data and therefore requires the rows to exist in the ledger. Give it a mode that runs the same
checkers over an **uncommitted candidate file**, with the ledger join skipped **by name** in the
output rather than silently dropped. It refused ten fabricated citations in the first batch it saw.
Found after the apply, each one costs a program version and a rollback; found before, nothing.

> A verifier that can only run on committed data finds everything exactly one round too late.

**2. The collisions no per-row check can see.** Three defect classes are invisible from inside any
single row *and* invisible to a citation checker:

| what | example |
|---|---|
| the proposed name is **already applied at a different address** | `LoadScreen::LoadScreen` proposed for one address when the ledger has carried it at another for 56 program versions |
| the same name proposed for **two addresses within the batch** | two batches independently reached the same label for different bodies |
| a row with **no name at all** | a reader that declines should emit no row; one that emits a blank leaves the applier to invent something |

Each needs a join over *the whole batch plus the whole ledger*. On the batch that motivated this, a
careful human read-through caught the first three defects in the delegation and **would have missed
the collision**, because nothing about that row looks wrong in isolation. That is the argument for
making the adjudicator a committed script with a selftest rather than a review pass.

**3. Refusal rules need their refusals sampled — a rule that refuses real evidence looks exactly
like a rule working.** The adjudicator's "is this class real?" rule reported a class as invented. It
had no exported member and appeared in no namespace anywhere — but four exported **mangled
signatures returned a pointer to it**, which is the linker asserting the class exists and spelling
its name. A drop is silent by construction: nothing downstream ever says *"a row was refused for a
bad reason."*

> Every refusal rule needs a selftest arm for **what it must NOT refuse**, written at the same time
> as the arm for what it must. Poison the rule and confirm the count moves in both directions.

**A delegated-batch adjudicator's rule set, as a starting point** (each demonstrated firing by
poisoning it, both directions):

- citations whose address is outside the image — external-space ordinals look like addresses
- a namespace/class the project cannot already justify from ground truth
- a qualified name already applied elsewhere, or proposed twice in the batch
- a citation that names *your own* applied markup rather than ground truth — the anti-circularity
  rule, at the adjudication layer, where it costs nothing
- two citations that are the same fact twice (an import and that import's own IAT slot)
- the confidence bar re-applied *after* citations have been dropped, demoting rather than deleting
- blank names and duplicate addresses

---

## Two things that bite when evidence is graded, not just checked

### Certainty and citability diverge, and the tier is where that goes

The most obvious identification in a batch is frequently the one with the **least** citable
evidence. Measured: a four-byte accessor, `return *(this+0x1c)`, whose reading is not seriously
arguable — and which touches no global, calls nothing, references no string, so exactly **one**
witness kind could be produced for it. Under a two-witness bar it is recorded at the lower tier,
beside readings far less certain than itself.

That is the grading working, not failing. The temptation at that moment is to reach for a second
citation that *technically* verifies — a neighbouring global, the vtable it happens to sit in — and
that is the move that turns a tier into a rubber stamp.

> **Record the reading at the tier its evidence supports, and say in the row why the evidence is
> thin.** A confident reading with one witness is more useful to the next round than a padded one
> with two, because the padding is invisible six months later and the note is not.

The corollary for anyone setting a bar: expect small leaf functions to cluster at the bottom tier,
and do not read that clustering as low quality.

### A checker that resolves a name through an artifact cannot see what the artifact omits

A citation of the form `slot <k> of class <C>` had its checker resolve `<C>` to a table address
through a committed hierarchy artifact. Classes absent from that artifact — which, on this project,
was *by definition* the entire population of unattributed tables — were **unciteable, even though
the slot pointer was sitting in memory the whole time.** The check was not wrong; it simply could
not be reached.

Letting the citation name the **address** (`slot <k> of table 0x…`) removed the lookup, and with it
the failure mode. Same rule as every other join in this document, applied one level up:

> **When a check needs a lookup to reach the program, the lookup is the weak link.** Prefer a
> citation that names a program address over one that names a label some artifact must translate.

Two consequences worth planning for: a checker's coverage is bounded by the artifacts it consults,
so **enumerate what those artifacts exclude** before believing a population is unciteable; and when
you add the address form, keep the name form working — existing rows rest on it, and loosening is
safe where replacing is not.

## A gate keyed on IDENTITY cannot police a change to an ATTRIBUTE

A ledger gate that joins "every markup symbol" to "every ledger row" **by address**, in both
directions, is the standard whole-program consistency check and it is a good one. It catches an
off-the-books apply (a symbol with no row), a rollback (a row with no symbol), and any drift in the
counts.

**It is structurally blind to a RENAME.** Change the name on one side only and the address is still
present in both directions, both counts are unchanged, and the gate passes. Measured: a project ran
this gate for dozens of rounds and it was never wrong, because every applier it had ever seen
**appended** — the failure mode simply could not arise. The first applier that rewrote a row
introduced a defect class no existing gate could express.

- **When you add an operation whose failure mode no existing gate can state, name the gate that does
  cover it — in the new script's own header**, where the next person looks. Here that was a separate
  probe joining by NAME rather than by address.
- **Ask of every gate: what does its KEY make invisible?** A join on address cannot see a name; a
  join on name cannot see an address move; a count sees neither. This is the same failure as *a
  wrong join key produces a MISSING answer, not a wrong one*, pointed at the gate rather than the
  harvester.

## Re-tighten a ratchet when the backlog SHRINKS

A ratchet — a committed ceiling on some backlog, asserted every gate pass — exists so the backlog
cannot grow without somebody deciding it should. Raising it is a deliberate act, usually recorded
with the round that earned it.

**Lowering it is just as load-bearing and is the half that gets forgotten.** A ceiling of 73 against
a true value of 68 silently permits five new unjustified entries, and the gate will report healthy
the whole time. The ratchet only measures anything while it is touching the number it tracks, so
move it down whenever the work moves the number down.

## A ratchet is an instrument only while it is FLUSH against the true value

A ratchet — a committed ceiling on some backlog, asserted every gate pass — is usually thought of
as a guard against growth, so the instinct is that only RAISING it matters. That is backwards, and
the cost is invisible.

**A ceiling left above the true value grants exactly as much unnoticed growth as the slack.** With a
ceiling of 73 against a true value of 68, five entries can accumulate one round at a time while the
gate reports healthy at every step.

**Measured.** One round promoted five backlog rows out of the tier and then tightened the ceiling
73 → 68 to follow — a step that read as bookkeeping at the time. Six rounds later another round
added **exactly one** row, and the gate raised at **69 vs 68**, forcing that single row to be
justified in writing before the ceiling moved. At 73 it would have been silent.

- **Lower the ratchet whenever the work lowers the number.** Slack accumulates across rounds because
  nothing reports it.
- **Price the tightening by what it will make VISIBLE, not by what it finds.** Its value never shows
  up in the round that does it; it shows up in the next round that adds one.
- **A ratchet that has never fired is not evidence of discipline — it may simply be slack.** Check
  the distance between the ceiling and the current value. If that distance is not zero, the gate is
  measuring nothing until the backlog grows past the gap.

## A check added BESIDE a gated check inherits no poison

When a new floor, arm or population is pinned next to an existing gated one — typically as the
replacement the existing one will eventually hand over to — the record tends to say *"poison: the same
one"*. Check which DIRECTION that poison exercises. Measured: a probe's positive floor was replaced by a
second floor over a population the work could not shrink, and the only poison on file made the detector
fire MORE, which the negative arm catches first; nothing had ever made the detector fire LESS on the real
program and watched the new floor catch it. The first act of the round that retired the old floor was to
write that poison (blind the detector's seed entirely), run it, and see the new floor raise at `0 of 39` —
because removing the old floor is only safe once something demonstrably guards the direction it guarded.

- **Every gate has two directions. Name the poison for each, not the poison for the gate.**
- **A hand-over between checks is a mutation of the assertion set**, and the rule that a changed condition
  is an undemonstrated assertion applies to the check that stays as much as to the one that goes.

## A poison arm that draws its SUBJECT from a shrinking population goes inert without a sound

An arm that picks *"the first candidate with verdict X"* is correct until the work removes the last
such row, and then it raises `LookupError` — which a selftest runner counts as a failure only if
somebody reads that selftest. Measured: 14 of 72 arms in a gate library had been inert for three rounds
because a three-row apply had emptied both populations they drew subjects from; among them was the poison
for the very check being retired, so that check had been undemonstrated for exactly as long. The library's
*consumer* ran its own 44-arm selftest, green throughout, and did not run these.

- **Before editing a selftest, run the COMMITTED copy** (stash, run, restore byte-identical). It is the
  one measurement that turns *"13 failures after my edit"* into *"14 before it, minus the arm I replaced."*
- **Arms that test a check reached BEFORE the subject's own verdict can take any subject**; a wrong-reason
  refusal still fails the arm if the arm requires the reason text. Arms that need the verdict itself need a
  synthetic subject, and building one re-adjudicates what the arm means — queue it with the count rather
  than delete it.
- **A selftest nothing runs is the same shape as a gate nothing runs.** Either the consumer's gate runs it
  or its count is pinned somewhere a gate reads.

## A control population is built by SUBTRACTING the treatment, not by listing sources

An applier's post-cascade control set was "every census row not in the plan, plus every caller of a
planned row" — and the callers were added without the subtraction. It held for two rounds because
no planned row happened to call another. The first wave large enough to be interesting had four
rows that call each other; the cascade rewrote them exactly as planned, the control check read that
as collateral damage, and the whole apply rolled itself back. Correct behaviour of the guard, wrong
construction of its population. Build controls as (every source) MINUS (the plan), then prove the
rollback held before re-running: a dry run in which every prior prototype still matches is that proof.

## A witness's false-positive rate is per SHAPE of negative, never the average

A caller-side witness (the last push before the call is the address of a caller local) measured 39
of 39 on the positive set and 27 of 2,987 (0.9%) on a negative set drawn outside it. Reported like
that it would have licensed rows on its own. Broken down by the negative's shape it was 0 of 2,494
on `char *` sites and **24 of 98 (24.5%) on `const Class &` sites** — a setter takes a local's
address exactly as a by-value-return caller does. The witness is therefore bound to its partner (the
callee's body must FILL and RETURN that address) and licenses nothing alone; the applier encodes that,
and the tool prints the per-shape table so the average cannot be read as the rate. **When a negative
set mixes shapes, the average is the theatre; print the worst shape and name it.**

## When a check grows a SECOND BRANCH, its existing poison covers the first one only

A structural check was extended with a second form for a case the first could not express. The
poison that had demonstrated it for three rounds was assumed to cover both. Measured: it reaches
only the original branch — the poison perturbs an index, and the new branch asks whether an index
EXISTS, so perturbing it leaves the answer true. Every row graded by the new branch PASSED the
poisoned run, and the arm still read as demonstrated because the run raised **on the other rows**.

- **Read WHICH rows a poison refused, never that the run raised.** A poison over a mixed population
  reports a single verdict for the whole run, and that verdict is satisfied by any subset.
- A new branch needs its own poison, and the one that works is usually the branch's own precondition
  inverted: here, forcing the declarer branch onto a body known to be an override.

## A rule about an INHERITANCE relation stated FOR ALL is almost always meant to be THERE EXISTS

"This body declares its slot" was written as *"no table holding it has an ancestor with that slot"*.
But a declared slot is INHERITED into every descendant table, so the body is also bound at that index
in tables whose ancestors do have it — which is what inheritance means, not a counterexample. The
universal form refused exactly the base-class rows, the ones most obviously correct. The right form is
*"SOME table INTRODUCES the slot holding this body"*.

**Grade the base class first.** A quantifier error on an inheritance relation shows up there before
anywhere else, and it shows up as a refusal of the row you are most confident about — which is the
cheapest possible signal, provided the round is reading refusals rather than counting them.

## A poison that cannot REACH its guard is not a poison

A population guard was written inside a per-class loop, *after* the filter that selects the classes
to repair. It could therefore only ever fire on a class that had already passed classification — so
a misattributed class that classifies as *sparse*, which is most of them, could never trip it. The
check sat in the file reading like a defence, and was unreachable.

Moving it to run over the whole population **before** anything is classified made it reachable, and
then it needed **two** poisons rather than one: any injected class present in both parentage records
trips the earlier *contradiction* arm first, so demonstrating the *descendant* arm required a class
one record has never heard of. **If one poison fires an arm you were not aiming at, you have not yet
demonstrated the arm you were aiming at** — add the second poison rather than accept the first
exit code.

## A poison that reports "did not fire" is a claim about the HARNESS first

The previous item is a poison that could not reach its guard because of where the guard sat. This one
is the same failure caused by the *test harness*, and it is more dangerous, because its output invites
you to go and "fix" a check that was working perfectly.

**Measured.** A guard inside a generator's merge step had just had its condition widened, so it was
re-poisoned: copy the input directory, corrupt the relevant file, run the generator against the copy,
expect a raise. It reported **"DID NOT FIRE — the guard is inert."** The guard was fine. The generator's
`main()` ignores `argv` and reads module-level constants for its input and output paths, so the
poisoned directory was never opened; the run read the real, healthy artifact and passed, exactly as it
should have.

Two rules:

- **Before believing a poison's verdict — in either direction — prove the poisoned input is what the
  code under test actually read.** A raise proves reachability by itself; a *pass* proves nothing until
  you can show the input arrived. Print the value the code loaded, or assert on a census the poison
  should have moved.
- **Prefer calling the function directly with the poisoned argument to influencing it across a process
  boundary.** Every layer between your poison and the guard — argv parsing, a module constant, an
  environment variable, a config file, a cached path — is a place the poison can be silently dropped.
  The fix here was to call the merge function with the poisoned directory as its parameter, which has
  no such layer.

## A condition CHANGED is an assertion UN-DEMONSTRATED

An assertion that was demonstrated firing, then had its condition edited, is back to being an untested
rule wearing a tested rule's clothes. The edit is usually made to accommodate a new case, under time
pressure, by someone who already knows the check works — which is exactly the state in which a guard
gets quietly weakened.

**Measured.** A vacuity guard read *"N rows and none of them reached a target cell: the join is broken,
not the file empty."* A new row state was introduced whose rows deliberately reach no cell. The first
edit added that state to the guard's **numerator** — treating one of the new rows as evidence that the
join works. The guard still fired on a totally empty result, still passed on a healthy one, and would
have reported a genuinely broken join as healthy whenever the input happened to contain one of the new
rows. Nothing about it looked like a regression. The correction took the new state out of the
**denominator** instead — *of the rows that SHOULD have reached a cell, at least one must have* — which
preserves the original strength exactly.

**Three arms is the shape for a re-demonstration, and the first is the one that matters:**

| arm | input | required |
|---|---|---|
| A | broken **with the new state present** | RAISE — this is the arm a weakened version passes |
| B | broken **with the new state absent** | RAISE — proof the original condition survived the edit |
| C | the real committed input | **quiet** — a guard that always fires grades nothing |

Arm A is the discriminating one and is the arm most likely to be skipped, because "I already know it
fires on a broken join" is true of arm B and feels like it covers both.

## When a new state satisfies a bucket's TEST but inverts its MEANING, split the bucket

A drift checker bucketed a cell as `RECORDED` when the program named it and a curated artifact had a
row for it — documented as *"expected, and the state that makes a rebuild lossless."* A new row state
meaning *this name is refuted, drop it* satisfies the same literal test (there is a row) and means the
exact opposite. Left folded in, the checker would have booked outstanding cleanup as *"accounted for"*,
in the one instrument whose job is to notice names that are out of step.

The test had stopped being a proxy for the intent. Split the bucket, and let the new count be the
tracker for the work — it should fall to zero when the work is done.

**Report such a count; do not ratchet it.** The neighbouring buckets are ratcheted to 0 because they
are defects. A deliberate-pending-loss count is *expected* to be non-zero until the debt is paid, so a
`max=0` ratchet on it is a gate that fails by design — which is a gate that gets excused, and an
excused gate grades nothing.

## Grade what the artifact CONTAINS, not what a variable holds

An AI-provenance filter check computed the filtered name into a variable, wrote a *different*
expression to the artifact, and asserted against the variable. Bypassing the filter therefore
changed only the output; the assertion compared the same two values it always had. The poison run
printed

```
A4: 1200 of 1947 referring functions are ledgered; the filter changed 1200 of them, 0 leaked
```

— **which is exactly what a healthy run prints** — and failed only on a backstop line at the
bottom. Regraded against the spelling actually written, it raises on 1044 of 1200.

Two things follow. **Run the poison FIRST**, before the clean run makes the output look
familiar; and when it reports nothing, believe it — a poison that produces a healthy-looking pass
is a defect in the check, not a clean program. The general form: **an assertion must read the
artifact's own value, not an intermediate the writer may have diverged from.**

## A census sent for approval is a CLAIM, and its prose is part of it

A repair census printed *"past the end of this struct"* for four records at an offset more than 60
bytes **inside** them. Every cell COUNT in that census was correct and survived unchanged into the
applied run. Only the *explanation* was invented — by an API assumption that had never been
measured — and it was caught because the number was impossible on its face, which is luck rather
than process.

A reviewer uses the prose to decide whether the numbers mean what they appear to. **A wrong reason
attached to a right row is still a false statement someone is being asked to sign**, and it is the
part of a census that nothing else checks: the counts get re-derived by the applier, the sentences
do not. Read them as critically as the figures, and when a sentence explains *why* a row was
skipped or refused, confirm the mechanism rather than inferring it from a return value.

## Record the MARGIN when a gate is cleared narrowly

A repair left four classes modelling 100 of 101 members — 99.0099% — against a threshold of
`>= 99.0`. The gate is green, honestly and by its own rule, and it is green **by 0.01 points**.

State that at the ratchet, with the reason the margin is thin and the change that would widen it.
A threshold cleared narrowly and silently becomes an unstated assumption that the margin will hold;
the next unrelated change in the same range tips it red, and the round that inherits the failure
has nothing to tell it whether it broke something or merely landed on a knife edge that was always
there.


## A fixture written from a description tests the description's author, not the format

When a file format is recovered by reading a binary, the recovery is prose: *"seventeen table
dwords in reverse order"*, *"a count followed by entries"*. A parser is then written from that
prose — and so, usually by the same person in the same sitting, is the synthetic fixture that
exercises it. The two agree by construction. They are one claim stated twice, and a passing suite
measures only that the author was self-consistent.

Measured instance: a container's tamper-protection footer was described as holding
`crc_table[17], [16], … [1]`. The bytes ascend; the phrase described the loader's *backwards scan*.
Parser and fixture both descended, six unit tests passed, and the parser found **zero** footers in
540 shipped files that all have one.

**So the acceptance test for a recovered format is the real artifact, and its expected numbers must
be measured before the parser exists** — otherwise they drift into agreement with it. Practically:

- Take a census of the shipped data with a throwaway script *first*, and hard-code those numbers as
  the corpus test's expectations. That script is not wasted; it is the only independent statement of
  the format you will get.
- Prefer an expectation with **two independent derivations**. A footer count of 181 from a byte
  signature and 181 from counting the records that demand a footer is worth pinning; either alone
  is a single point of failure shared with the parser.
- Where the data cannot be committed (shipped game assets, licensed corpora), gate the test on an
  environment variable naming the install and skip with a printed notice elsewhere. A skipped
  corpus test is honest. A green suite that never touched a real byte is not.

Synthetic fixtures keep their job: they are the only way to demonstrate a *rejection* path firing,
because damaged input is exactly what a real corpus does not contain. Build them to break one rule
each. Just do not let them stand in for evidence that the happy path is right.

## A check that opens with a `continue` cannot police what it skips — write down the skipped population

The blind spot is created by one line and is invisible thereafter, because everything the check
*does* see is verified and looks healthy. Measured on a 1999 MSVC/x86 project:

A gate over the PE export table asserted *"every parsed member symbol carries a declaring class"*,
and opened with

```python
if parse_mangled(row["mangled_name"])["kind"] != "member":
    continue
```

That `continue` skips every **special** name — constructors, destructors, `operator=`, `??_7`
vftables — which on this binary is **111 of 1970 rows**. Behind it, the project's own demangler had
been returning `parse_status="ok"` while leaving `member` empty for **all** of them. The gate ran
green for a whole phase; the committed artifact shipped `CRobotAssemblyBay::` with nothing after the
colons; and two independent investigators eventually hit the blank and demangled by hand rather than
suspect the tool. **The population the check could not see is where the defect had accumulated,
precisely because everything visible was being verified.**

The rule, which costs one comment at the time and is unrecoverable later:

- **When a check begins by excluding a kind, state in the code what the exclusion drops and HOW MANY
  ROWS it is** — as a fraction of the population, never a bare count. "skips non-member kinds"
  conceals it; "skips the 111 of 1970 special names" does not.
- **If the excluded set is a whole KIND rather than a handful of known rows, it needs its own check,
  not an exemption.** The exclusion is usually there because the kind needs *different* handling,
  which is the same reason it needs separate verification.
- **Give the new check a companion that pins its own denominator.** A check of the form "for each row
  where a function exists at this address…" silently becomes vacuous if every row starts taking the
  `fn is None` path. The companion here asserts that the rows *without* a function are exactly the
  `??_7` vftables (data symbols by construction), so the first check's coverage cannot fall to zero
  unnoticed. Demonstrate it alone: re-point one constructor at a data address and only the companion
  may fire.

**And grade the repair against an implementation you did not write.** The expected values here were
never written down in the project — they were read out of Ghidra's own demangler, a separate
implementation of the same Microsoft spec, joined **by address**, agreeing on 96 of 97. The single
divergence (`??B`, a user-defined conversion whose target type is in the *signature*, not in the
special code) was documented *before* the grading run and pinned to that one address, so a second
divergence is a failure rather than a quietly widening allowance. A decoder graded against its own
table has measured nothing.

## A poison that fires NOTHING is worse news than one that fires the wrong guard

The rule "read WHICH check refused, not merely that one refused" has a failure mode below it that
looks identical in a summary line. Measured on one round that added five new guards and nine poison
arms: **three arms hit a guard other than the one they named, and one hit nothing at all.**

| arm | aimed at | actually fired |
|---|---|---|
| "absorbs nothing" | the vacuity rule | the STRADDLE rule — a partly-overlapped neighbour straddles before vacuity is ever reached |
| "claims more bytes than any witness covers" | the extent rule | the NAME-DESTRUCTION rule — the chosen span's uncovered remainder was 1 byte, not 5, so the extent rule did not apply and the arm sailed past it into the names beyond |
| "starts on no witness" | the base-offset rule | **nothing** — the offset chosen as "mid-member" was itself a cell start |

The first two still prove *a* guard works. **The third proves nothing, and it is the one that ships
silently**, because a harness reporting `80 checks, 0 failures` reads the same whether an arm
demonstrated its rule or merely failed to break anything. An `expect_raises` helper catches it only
because it treats "did not raise" as failure; nothing at all catches an arm that raises the *wrong*
exception except a human reading the message.

**So: read the raise text of every arm, every time, and treat an arm whose poison turned out to be
valid input as an UNTESTED rule rather than a satisfied one.**

Two constructional sub-rules, both paid for in that round:

- **A poison for a "this region is too big / has unexplained bytes" rule cannot be built out of
  PADDING.** Padding is bounded by the alignment maximum *by definition*, so a span made of it can
  never exceed the threshold. It needs an explicitly-*unknown* region.
- **A poison for "starts on nothing" needs a GAP, not an interior offset.** In a gap-free tiling
  every interior offset is some cell's start. The intuition "the second of four components is
  mid-member" is false precisely when the four components are four separate cells — which is the
  case the rule exists for.

## Making an artifact more EXPRESSIVE enlarges what an existing check can grade

A check that grades "every row with a decided name" has a denominator that moves whenever naming
moves. Measured: a round taught a layout artifact to express grouped members, which named three
previously-anonymous offsets; a descendant-drift probe that had been green immediately reported
three faults against a ratchet ceiling of zero.

**Nothing had regressed.** Those three offsets had never been in that probe's population, so it had
never been able to look at them; the faults were pre-existing, and two other gates were already
reporting the same three cells.

Both of the obvious readings are wrong and expensive. Reading it as a regression raises the ceiling
and buries three real faults. Reading it as "my change broke something" reverts a correct change.

**The discriminator: does the newly-graded population OVERLAP what another gate already reports?**
If yes, it is newly visible, not newly wrong. If no, it is a genuine finding and deserves its own
investigation.

Practical consequence: **state a check's denominator in the round's write-up whenever it moves, not
only when its verdict does.** In that incident the probe had been printing `grading the 82 with a
DECIDED NAME` all along, and the number had been 74 the previous day. The information was on screen
and nobody was watching that column.

## A poison arm can be undemonstrable against the POPULATION, not the harness

*"A poison that reports `did not fire` is a claim about the HARNESS first"* is right, and it has a
second reading that costs a round if you miss it: sometimes the harness is fine and **the arm is
unreachable on this particular data**. Three arms failed in one round, each for a different reason,
and only the third looks like an obvious mistake:

1. **The branch is unreachable on this population.** An arm loosened a rule to accept a wrong witness
   shape (a register used as a *scaled index* rather than a base pointer) and moved nothing — because
   every function that ever reached such an operand had already satisfied the rule legitimately
   earlier in the same body, so the loosened branch was never evaluated. **That is not a safety
   argument for the rule.** It is a fact about the sample, and it means the arm proves nothing here.
   Delete it, and record why, or a later round re-proposes it.

2. **The pinned count SATURATES.** The arm targeted *"does at least one witness qualify?"* — a
   boolean that is already true. Accepting extra bogus witnesses cannot move a value at its ceiling.
   **Poison a count that can move**: the total over every classification, not the per-subject
   any/none. Pin both; the boolean is what the verdict uses, the total is what the poison can reach.

3. **An apply emptied the arm's target.** The arm flipped a `repair` verdict; after the apply there
   were no `repair` verdicts left, so it silently became a no-op. **Re-demonstrate every arm after an
   apply changes the population** — an arm demonstrated pre-apply is not demonstrated post-apply, and
   the meta-check ("poison run passed") is the only thing that catches it.

The surviving arm poisoned the rule that actually decides rows, and moved three separate pinned
counts. That is the shape to aim for: **an arm should break the thing the verdict depends on, not a
thing adjacent to it.**

## Read the WITNESS a rule printed, not the count it produced

A rule that identifies evidence must print the specific item that satisfied it, and you must read a
sample. Measured: a rule scoring a healthy-looking **26 of 27** was citing, as proof that a register
held an object pointer, instructions that *overwrite* that register (`LEA ECX,[ESP+0xc]`, `POP ECX`,
`IMUL ECX,EAX`) and one where it was a scaled table index. The count looked right; six of the reasons
behind it were wrong. Nothing but reading the printed instructions could have shown that — no
assertion was violated, no total was implausible.

The correction has its own trap. The fixed rule landed on **the same rows** as the broken one, so the
numbers had been right by luck the whole time. **A rule reaching the right answer is not evidence
that it reaches it for the right reason**, and only the per-item witness distinguishes them.

Over-correction is the mirror image and just as easy: the first fix here rejected the target
platform's *standard idiom* for the thing being detected, and quietly discarded a third of the real
evidence. When you tighten a rule, check what it now REFUSES, with the same sampling.
## Keep a replaced rule in the file, wired to its own poison arm

When a rule that produced *committed results* is found unsound and replaced, deleting it is tidier
and worse. Keep it, unused, as a poison arm.

Measured: a similarity-based grouping rule was replaced by one based on recovered parentage. The old
rule stayed in the file behind a `poisonglobal` flag. The arm is unusually good precisely because it
is not a reconstruction — it is the original — and injecting it moves four separate pinned counts
*and* reproduces on demand the specific false positive that motivated the replacement. A reader
comparing the two functions sees exactly what changed and why.

The general shape: **a poison arm modelled on a real historical defect cannot drift from the thing it
models.** A hand-written "wrong version" can, and usually does, become subtly easier to catch than
the mistake it stands in for.

## An adjudicated exception is a NUMBER, not a category

A round found one already-applied row whose evidence no longer held, and the decision was to record
the downgrade rather than revert it. The naive way to encode that is a check that tolerates rows in
that state — which then waves through every future one, silently, forever.

Instead pin the **count**, with the address in the constant's comment:

```python
EXPECT_APPLIED_UNWITNESSED = 1     # 0xNNNNNNNN Class::Method, slot 109 (§284)
EXPECT_APPLIED_UNTESTABLE  = 1     # 0xNNNNNNNN Class::Method, vftable unmapped
```

The check does not raise on the adjudicated row; it raises the moment either population **changes
size**. A second such row then stops the gate instead of joining a standing exemption. **Never widen
the constant to make a gate pass — adjudicate the new row.**

## Split a status that has come to mean several things

One status had accreted three outcomes needing opposite responses: *still supported*, *supported by
evidence this instrument cannot examine*, and *support disproved*. Collapsed into one label, the only
one that mattered was invisible; the fix was three verdicts, not a footnote in prose beside the
artifact. **When adjudication finds a status covering outcomes that call for different actions, split
the status.**

## Make the control group the nearest neighbours, not the leftovers

A first round used its own abstentions as the control for its apply. The follow-up used *every row
not being applied* — which now included the rows the first round had already treated. Those are the
closest possible neighbours of the treatment group in class, shape and provenance, so they are where
a stray effect of the apply or its cascade would actually show. **Prefer a control group that has
already received the same treatment over one that was merely never eligible.**

## Where two artifacts partition a population, assert the partition

A sweep drew its population from two artifacts — "still outstanding" and "already done" — which are
disjoint by construction. Run in the wrong order after an apply, three addresses appeared in both. A
one-line intersection assertion named them; without it the population would have carried silent
duplicates and surfaced rounds later as an unexplained count. **Assert the partition, not just the
total.**


## A gate's premise about ITSELF goes stale like any other claim — and it lives where no audit looks

A stability harness that re-runs your producers and byte-compares their artifacts is usually a
project's most trusted instrument. It is also the one whose *own* assumptions nobody re-derives,
because everything it reports is about something else.

**Measured.** A harness drove two populations: `SWEEPS` (which write artifacts) and `PROBES`
(asserted on their printed verdict). It ran the probes **after** taking its comparison snapshot,
computing the artifact diff and computing coverage — on a premise it printed on every pass:
*"driven probes … they write no artifact, so the diff above cannot see them."* True when written.
Then one probe began writing an artifact, and the sentence became false inside the instrument that
audits everything else.

- **REGISTERING SOMETHING NEW WITH A GATE IS A TEST OF THE GATE, AND IT IS FREE.** The intent was
  bookkeeping. The harness answered `REACH FAULTS: 1 committed CSV … neither regenerated nor
  excluded` in the same run that printed `wrote …(120 rows)` twenty lines above. Nothing about the
  artifact was wrong. The only way to find the defect was to hand the gate a shape it had never
  been handed.
- **THE LOUD HALF AND THE SILENT HALF HAD OPPOSITE SIZES.** Loud: one coverage fault, refusing the
  whole run. Silent: because the write landed after the snapshot, **the artifact was never
  byte-compared at all** — a probe writing something *different* would still have produced
  `0 CHANGED`. The half that shouted was the harmless one. Ask of any gate reporting coverage:
  *what does it do with a thing that arrives after it has finished measuring?*
- **THE WRONG FIX WAS ALSO THE UNDETECTABLE ONE.** Adding the artifact to the "deliberately
  excluded" table would have silenced the fault in one line, and that table's self-retiring guard —
  *an exclusion whose artifact IS regenerated raises* — could not have caught it, because under the
  old ordering the artifact was never counted as regenerated. **A self-retiring exclusion does not
  retire when the thing that would retire it runs too late to be seen.**
- **FIX BY ORDERING, NOT BY A SECOND DIFF.** Running the probes *before* the snapshot puts both
  populations under one diff and one coverage arithmetic. Re-snapshotting afterwards and folding the
  result in would have been a second copy of the diff logic — the "one home for a rule" failure this
  file exists to prevent. When moving a block inside a large gate, anchor on CONTENT rather than
  memorised line numbers, and assert that the moved block references nothing defined in the section
  it jumped over.
- **AND THE CLAIM WAS INVISIBLE TO THE PROJECT'S OWN CLAIM AUDITOR**, which read `#` comment lines
  in `.py` and never string literals. A claim about a tool, emitted *by* that tool, inside a
  `print(...)`. If you have an instrument that hunts unbacked claims about your tooling, ask what
  syntax it cannot see before trusting its zero.

**A ground-truth refusal beats a constructed poison here.** A poisoned copy restoring the old
ordering was built and discarded unrun: the first live run had already demonstrated the failure, on
real data, for the real reason.

## Share an implementation; never share the number a check is graded against

A gate and the probe it trusts frequently need the same calibration constant — a floor, a ceiling,
an expected population. Importing it from one to the other is the instinct, and it is wrong.

**Measured.** A premise gate rested on a probe's calibration (*21 of 25 ground-truth rows must
classify a certain way*). The gate defines `CALIBRATION_FLOOR = 21` **as its own literal**, a second
definition of the probe's. Importing it would make the two agree *by construction*: the gate would
follow the probe silently wherever the probe moved, and a probe re-calibrated downward would drag
its own gate down with it, still green.

Two independent literals that must agree convert a drift into a **disagreement somebody has to
adjudicate**. This is the deliberate exception to "one copy of a rule on disk": share the code that
computes, never the threshold the computation is judged against.

## A refusal that FIRES is not a refusal that fired for its REASON

A guard that refuses when it should is usually taken as proven. It is not: it has been shown to
produce the right *verdict*, which is a much weaker claim than producing it for the right reason.

**Measured.** A batch applier compared an approved change-list against the rows that would actually
fire and raised on any difference. It refused a deliberately-shortened list correctly on every run —
while its parser was returning `('', '', '<- witness…')` for every row. It was comparing garbage
against garbage and reaching the correct answer. A test asserting *"this run refused"* would have
passed forever, and so would the exit status.

- **Assert on the refusal's CONTENT** — the addresses, the values, the reason string — not on the
  fact of refusal. That is the only thing separating a working guard from a coincidence. A harness
  that prints what a failing probe *said* is the same instinct one level down; this is the version
  that belongs in the arm itself.
- **A COUNT-BASED VACUITY GUARD IS BLIND TO A SHAPE CHANGE.** The parser above asserted it had
  recovered as many rows as the header claimed. When the format grew from one line per row to two,
  it began counting one *witness* line per row — the count matched exactly while every field was
  wrong. Guard the SHAPE (this field is an 8-hex address, this one is a registered enum value, this
  one is non-empty), not the tally. A guard on how many is blind to what.
- **Both defects here scored green on exit status**, and both were found by reading text. Where a
  check's output is the evidence, a run nobody read is a run that did not happen.

## Changing a RENDERING is an interface change, and the consumer breaks silently

Text output that another component parses is an interface, whether or not anyone wrote one down —
and it is the interface people forget is one, because it has no signature to break.

**Measured.** Removing a truncation from a census renderer — a correct, necessary fix — silently
broke a parser in another component within the hour. The sweep that would have named the victim in
advance was one command: grep for the function symbol, which returned exactly three files.

**Before changing any rendering another component reads, enumerate its consumers and say what each
one does with it.** Then change them together. The same rule as "a rule change in a producing sweep
needs an old-vs-new diff", pointed at the one output nobody thinks of as data.

## A status flag that conflates two failure kinds makes its consumers diverge

When a result object carries a boolean `passed` and a list of `refused` items, the boolean will be
false for two structurally different reasons, and independent consumers will read it differently.

**Measured.** A category gate refused both when its *premise* collapsed (false for every row that
rests on it) and when a single row was *inadmissible* (false for nothing). One consumer read
`passed=False` as "drop the whole category"; another dropped only the listed rows. Neither reading
is unreasonable, and the divergence was expensive in two directions: one bad proposal would have
discarded 432 good ones, and because the two consumers must produce identical sets for a drift check
to pass, a perfectly healthy batch could never have been applied at all.

**The fix needed no new field.** The item list was already correct for both cases, because a premise
failure is expanded to every row *by the gate that knows it failed*. So:

- **the list is the decision; the boolean is for reporting** — say so in the docstring, because the
  next consumer's author will otherwise re-derive the wrong reading;
- **then make it a contract**: raise if a result is `passed=False` with an EMPTY list. Otherwise a
  future category's premise failure reads as "nothing to drop" and the whole category is APPLIED —
  the failure in the direction that writes to the program.

**And note the shape, because it recurs**: two components deriving the same population by different
routes, with nothing asserting they agree. Where two components must compute the same set, one
should CALL the other, or a check should assert the two agree on real data — and that check must
then be tested for firing on the right *reason*, per the section above.

## A gate ratifies a guess when the guesser and the gate read the same way

The standard defence against a bad automated proposal is a gate that re-derives the claim from the
binary and compares. It is a real defence, and it has one hole that no amount of gate-hardening
closes: **where the underlying evidence is ambiguous, the producer's guess and the gate's
re-derivation will usually make the SAME guess**, because they scan the same bytes in the same
order. The gate then ratifies it, and a guess ratified by a checker sharing its bias is
indistinguishable from a measurement.

**Measured.** A generator emitted a name for each compiler-generated initializer, derived from the
global that body writes. 106 of 441 bodies write more than one global — one writes 144. "Take the
first store" would have produced a plausible name for every one of them, and the gate, taking the
first store too, would have agreed. The generator instead **emitted nothing and recorded the address
and the reason**; 122 of 489 candidate rows died there. That refusal count is the wave's most
valuable output, not its shortfall.

- **Where a body admits more than one derivation, refuse.** A smaller correct wave beats a larger
  one carrying invisible guesses, and the deferrals are a queued backlog with addresses rather than
  a worry.
- **Make the producer INDEPENDENT of the gate.** If the producer imports the gate's helpers,
  "N of N passed" is a tautology — the gate is confirming the producer's own arithmetic. Share the
  schema and the file format; never the rule that turns evidence into a claim.
- **Give the gate a question whose answer you already know.** Do not generate over the pre-filtered
  population expected to pass. Generate over the WHOLE one and predict the refusals: here the
  calibration named nine addresses that must be refused, the gate refused exactly those nine, and
  the producer had predicted the same nine independently. That turns a green run from *"nothing
  objected"* into *"two separately-written readers agree on the accepts AND the rejects"*.
- **`input = emitted + skipped`, asserted, is the only thing that sees a FALSE NEGATIVE.** A gate
  judges only what was emitted, so a too-narrow pattern is invisible to it: the wave quietly does
  less than it should and reports success. Make the arithmetic raise, and check that each leg is a
  measurement — one leg here defined its population by the same predicate that later emitted, so
  `36 = 36 + 0` was an identity that could never fail.

## A dry run that skips a stage rehearses only the parts that were already easy

A mutating tool's dry run exists so the apply holds no surprises. It earns that only if it executes
every stage except the write.

**Measured.** A batch applier's dry run stopped before the signature parser. The parse was therefore
the one failure class discoverable only by attempting a real apply — and that is exactly how it was
discovered, with the whole batch rolling back. The fix is one line of ordering: parse and translate
every row during the dry run, discard the result, and report `N of N parsed`.

**And the root cause was upstream of the parse, in a place no failure pointed at.** A constant
`PROTO_ARGS = (True, False)` sat under a comment naming the API's second argument
`includeCallingConventionOverride` — **a parameter name that does not exist**. The real signature
took `(formalSignature, includeCallingConvention)`, and `formalSignature=True` silently omits
auto-parameters. Two consequences, neither visible from the failure: one guard was structurally
dead, and the pre-mutation snapshot — the round's only way back — had been recording an unfaithful
"before" state. **A comment asserting an API's shape is a tool claim like any other**, and it is one
a claim-auditing sweep will miss, because it names nothing checkable.

The compensating design worth copying: the failed apply wrote **nothing**. One transaction, 367
writes, atomic rollback. Concentrating mutation in a single bracketed applier — rather than
spreading it across per-round scripts — is what made a defect in the mutating component cost one
re-run instead of a program to repair.

## A schema field nothing READS is a check you believe you have

A gate can be missing in a way no gate detects: the *data it would grade* is collected faithfully,
round after round, and no code ever opens the column.

**Measured.** A naming catalog carried a `prediction` field — described in every delegated reader's
brief as *"a falsifiable consequence of your name being right"* — for **987 rows across 13 rounds**.
The identifier appears in the catalog's verifier exactly once, **inside the schema header list**. No
checker touches it. Eight other scripts in the same pipeline carry it through a header list or a
plan tuple and write it back out unchanged. The project meanwhile made predictions gate-bearing in
three *mutating* appliers, one of whose headers reads *"the prediction is the TEST — reconcile it,
do not adjust it to match"*. The pipeline that collected predictions was the one place that graded
none.

**The reason it survived thirteen rounds with every gate green is the part worth keeping:**

> There is no observable state in which an **ungraded** field differs from a field that is
> **checked and always passes**. Schema checks, encoding checks, ledger joins and byte-identity
> canaries all pass on a full column exactly as they would on a graded one.

So the defect is invisible to every instrument *except* the question *who consumes this column?* —
which nothing asks on a schedule. Two cheap habits close it:

- **When you add a field to a schema, name its consumer in the same commit**, or write
  `# NOT GRADED` beside it. An ungraded field is legitimate; an ungraded field that reads as
  graded is not.
- **Periodically invert the artifact/consumer map.** A tool that answers *"which script writes
  this CSV"* is usually already present; the useful direction is the other one, per column.

**And check what the collected values actually claim before switching a check on.** Of the 912
`decided` rows above, **586 (64%)** carried one boilerplate sentence — *"this body still references
**the cited** string and **the cited** global"* — which restates the row's own citations, i.e.
exactly what the citation checker already re-verifies every pass. Grading them would have graded the
population against itself. **A prediction that names only what the row already cites is a
restatement wearing a prediction's column**, and it is the guesser-and-gate-read-the-same-way
failure moved one column over.

**The corollary that pays.** The remaining 243 rows had converged, unprompted, across **seven
separate rounds**, on one shape: **exclusivity** — *"no other body calls this import"*, *"the ONLY
non-vtable caller"*, *"never reached by any other class"*. That is the right shape for a structural
reason, and a grammar invented at a desk had missed it: a citation says *this body references S*,
and the falsifiable consequence of the **name** is *and nothing else does* — **a whole-program query
the reader could not run and its evidence pack did not contain.** When you finally build the checker
for a long-collected field, **derive its grammar from what the producers already wrote**, not from
what a clean design would prefer. They have been solving the problem for longer than you have.

## A 100% pass rate is a corroboration only after you measure the BASE RATE of violation

A check that returns *N of N pass* is reporting one of two very different things, and the output
looks identical either way: *"the population genuinely has this property"*, or *"this property is
structurally impossible to violate here"*. The second is an unfireable arm with a healthy-looking
number in front of it.

**Measured.** A predicted claim — *"slot 38 of this class's vtable is never reached by any other
class"* — was checked over 203 catalog rows: **203 OK, 0 FAIL, 0 unresolvable.** Clean sweeps are
exactly when to stop and ask. The follow-up query was one line over the same artifact: of the
**1,779** distinct vtable targets in the program, **708 (39.8%)** appear in more than one vtable. So
the claim is violable by two functions in five, the 203 sit in the satisfying minority, and the pass
is a real corroboration. Had the answer been *0 of 1,779 are multi-table*, the 203 would have been a
tautology, and the check would have been reporting health it never measured.

- **The base rate is usually one aggregate over the artifact the check already reads.** It costs
  nothing next to writing the check, and it converts *"nothing objected"* into *"the property held
  where 40% of comparable cases would have broken it"*.
- **Print it beside the verdict**, the same way a vacuity guard prints `empty=` and `unexercised=`
  as values. A reader who sees `203/203` cannot tell; a reader who sees `203/203, base rate of
  violation 39.8% over 1779` can.
- **The demonstration still matters, and prefer ground truth to construction.** Here the same claim
  asserted for four *real* multi-table bodies — one of them reached from **225** vtables — returned
  `PASS=False` on all four, which is a stronger arm than the constructed poison beside it because
  nothing about it had to be fabricated.

**A measured zero from the same sweep is worth keeping even when nothing needs it.** The base-rate
query above also returned *0 of 1,779 targets appear at more than one distinct slot **index***, i.e.
a function occupies one slot number across every table that holds it. No claim depended on it; it is
a whole-population invariant that cost nothing to observe and would cost a round to re-derive.

## A comment describing a branch is not a branch

The same round found the inverse failure — a query tool that **answered where it should have
refused**, with exit 0.

**Measured.** A corpus exporter wrote two of its program-wide indices as empty lists, under a
comment reading *"a bounded trial writes them EMPTY rather than partial, because a partial index
reads exactly like a measured absence."* The reasoning is correct and **the branch it describes does
not exist**: the full export writes them empty too. The two CLI commands built on those indices then
printed nothing (exit 0) and `no recorded writer for <addr>` (exit 0), for a string with three real
referrers and a global with real writers — three of the seven evidence kinds the whole pipeline runs
on, silently unserviceable.

> A comment asserting a code path is a tool claim like any other, and it is one a claim-audit sweep
> will miss, because it names nothing checkable. **Grade the branch, not the comment**: if a
> conditional matters, there is a run of the tool in each arm that proves it.

And for anything that answers queries over an index: **an empty index must produce a refusal, not an
answer.** The rule is the same one that governs a stale stamp — print what to do instead of
returning a result the caller cannot distinguish from a measurement.

### Two sharpenings of the base-rate rule, from the round that first used it

**1. A base rate measured over the population you selected FOR passing is the vacuity it was meant
to detect.** Measured: the first cut computed one form's violation rate over *the addresses the
artifact cites* and reported **0.0%** — which is not a base rate, it is the checked rows passing,
restated with a percent sign. Over the comparable population (every string any body references) the
answer was **9.2%**. The denominator must be the population the checked rows were drawn FROM, never
the checked rows.

**2. A claim can be TRUE and still not worth checking, and retiring it is a result.** One form was
seeded, evaluated and withdrawn inside a single round. Its rows failed; adjudicating them showed
every failure was the *checker's* fault, not the reader's. The obvious repair was then **measured
before being written** and turned out to be satisfied by 307 of 312 comparable cases — a 1.6%
violation rate — because the behaviour it tested for *is the language idiom the claim describes*, so
the claim's own exception clause swallowed its assertion. It was retired rather than shipped weak,
with the rule kept in the file wired to its own arm.

> Ship the measurement, not the arm. A check at a 1.6% base rate spends real runtime to report a
> property nothing was going to violate, and it does it wearing the same green as a check that means
> something.

## Writing assertion arms is not knowing they can fail — mutate the source

Arms are written against the failures the author imagined. The ones that matter are the guards that
looked too simple to need an arm.

**Measured.** Ten deliberate one-line breaks to a freshly written, heavily-armed module: **nine
fired the arm written for them, and one — deleting a duplicate-row guard in the loader — was not
detected at all**, with the selftest still reporting *34 of 34 pass*. Three further breaks made an
arm raise a domain exception rather than fail its assertion, so the harness printed a **traceback**
where it should have named the broken check; the selftest still exited non-zero, so the mutation was
caught, but the report answered *"something broke"* where the whole purpose is *"THIS check broke"*.

Both are cheap to close and neither is visible without mutating:

- **The arm-runner catches every exception, not just `AssertionError`.** Anything narrower converts
  an informative failure into a stack trace at exactly the moment you need the name.
- **Mutate one guard at a time and record which arm fires.** An unfired mutation is a missing arm;
  a mutation that fires three arms is usually correct (one guard, several consequences), and a
  mutation that fires an *unrelated* arm is a coupling worth knowing about.
- Do it **when the code is written**, not later. The undetected guard above was in the function that
  looked least risky, which is why it had no arm and why nothing else would ever have found it.

### The mutation harness is source too, and it is wrong first

The most convincing mutation report is the one where the harness itself is broken: **every mutant
"fails", nothing is measured, and the run prints `7/7 detected`.** Measured — seven mutants of a
producer were written to a temp directory and every one exited non-zero on `FileNotFoundError`,
because the script derives its repo root from `__file__` and the copy was outside it. Not one arm
had fired.

Two lines close it, and they turn the harness into an instrument that can report its own failure:

- **Run the mutants where the original runs**, and **assert an UNMUTATED copy at that same path
  PASSES first.** A baseline that fails means the harness is broken, and every result after it is
  noise.
- **Require the failure to come from a NAMED ARM, not from a non-zero exit.** Grep the output for
  the arm's own label. A crash, a usage error and a fired assertion all exit non-zero, and only one
  of them is evidence.

Do the same for the arms themselves once they pass: a mutation that fires an arm you did not aim at
is telling you the arm you *did* aim at is not testing what its name says.

### A presence check over a two-source join tests the UNION, not the source you meant

A row assembled from two witnesses — two decoders, two sweeps, a probe plus an artifact — appears in
the output if **either** contributed it. So `X is in the result` is an assertion about the union, and
it stays green while the source you actually care about goes silent.

**Measured.** A producer joined its own parse against a second decoder's and tagged each row
`both` / `a_only` / `b_only`. Two arms asserted that six specific classes "survive", by membership.
Mutating the parse to drop all six left both arms green: the rows were still there, now tagged
`b_only`, and nothing looked at the tag. The arms now assert `witness == both`, and the mutation
that motivated the tightening is what fires them.

The general form: **assert the row's PROVENANCE, not its existence**, wherever a row can arrive by
more than one route. The tag already exists — a join that classifies its rows and then checks them
without reading the classification has built the instrument and thrown away the reading.

### A vacuity guard written for the poison case will fire on the live one

Guards that exist so a poison arm has something to trip are usually described as ceremony. Two
measured cases say otherwise, and in both the guard fired on **real input, before any poison ran**:

- A cross-check probe called `DemanglerUtil.demangle(program, name, addr)`, which on Ghidra 12.1.2
  returns a `java.util.List` rather than a `DemangledObject` — so `getDataType()` was simply absent
  and the probe reported a decoded type for **0 of 979** symbols. That reads as *"the second decoder
  has nothing to say about these"*, which is a finding, rather than as *"this is the wrong entry
  point"*, which is a bug. `if decoded == 0: raise` said so in one line.
- A sweep whose whole product is an agreement count, run against an artifact that had not been
  regenerated: it compared nothing and would have reported health.

So write the guard for the shape of the answer — *"this producer's entire output is a comparison; a
comparison of zero things is a broken instrument, not a clean result"* — and let the poison arm be
the demonstration rather than the reason.

### A schema or a check that embeds a fact the pipeline routinely rewrites will go stale silently

Ask of every stored string: **which part of this does a later round routinely change?** That part is
a fact about the program, not about the check, and freezing it inside the check turns the check into
a claim that the program never moves.

Four measured instances in a single round, all the same species:

- a gate comparing a **rendered prototype** as a whole string — the rendering embeds the function's
  own name and the `this` parameter's type, both of which a naming round rewrites, so twelve
  correctly-unchanged signatures were reported as partial reverts;
- an evidence pack citing a neighbour **by name** where the name may still be the disassembler's
  placeholder;
- a template set embedding an **input format** the producer had since changed;
- an example in a brief writing an integer in **hex** where the grammar's type is decimal — and five
  independent readers copied the example rather than the type.

The last one generalises past schemas: **an example in a brief IS a specification.** Readers follow
the example.

### A check nothing runs is a premise decaying unobserved

A probe that is in no harness — no sweep list, no gate, no CI — still contains assertions, and those
assertions are claims about a program that keeps changing. It does not fail quietly; it does not
fail at all, because nothing invokes it. The next person to run it finds a raise, and cannot tell
whether they broke it.

Measured: seven producers were edited in one round and run by hand afterwards. One raised —
*"`CBasicGobject +0x1c4` is now named `TargetHandle`; the gap this probe measures has been closed by
some other route"* — an assertion working exactly as designed, about a fact that had changed some
rounds earlier. It was in neither of the two lists the harness drives.

- **Registering a probe is what keeps its premise honest.** If it is too expensive to run every
  pass, excuse it *by name with a reason*, so the exemption is visible; an unlisted probe is neither
  covered nor excused, it is invisible.
- **When you touch a script the harness does not drive, run it, and run the PRE-EDIT copy too.**
  `git show HEAD:path` into a scratch name, run both, diff the output. Otherwise a pre-existing
  failure becomes yours and a failure you introduced becomes "it was already like that" — and both
  mistakes are made in the same direction, toward the answer that costs less.

### A licence recorded in a round's WRITE-UP is not a licence the next round inherits

The dangerous form is not a missing check. It is a check that was **run once, by hand, and
reported in prose** — because the prose reads like the property holds, and the next round
inherits the conclusion without the test.

Measured. An applier relabels a calling convention on the argument that two conventions pass
their first parameter in the same register. True of the *convention table*; a claim about a
*body* only if that body has no argument in the register the two conventions do **not** share.
One round knew this, ran a liveness probe by hand over its 13 targets, and wrote *"13 of 13
dead"* in its write-up as the independent witness the original argument lacked. Nine rounds
later the same producer issued a fresh census, adjudicated **without** it. Re-run: of six
proposed repairs, **four clean, one refused, one actively contradicted** — a third of the census
resting on a verdict nobody had asked for.

- **If a hand-run check licensed an apply, the next apply must not be able to skip it.** Emit the
  verdict as an artifact and have the producing rule CONSUME it. A precondition that lives in a
  round's notes is a precondition with a one-round half-life.
- **Have the producer and the checker read the bytes differently.** If the rule that proposes and
  the gate that grades both compute liveness the same way, their agreement proves nothing.
- And when you propose the apply: **read what the PREVIOUS round used to license the same
  operation before writing the census**, not after. In this incident a census of six went out for
  approval on body reads alone and two rows had to be withdrawn.

### `if not X` catches an EMPTY join, never a MISMATCHED one — count what matched

A lookup between two artifacts fails in two ways, and the guard everyone writes catches only the
harmless one. `if not TABLE: raise` fires when the file is empty. It cannot fire when both sides
are fully populated and simply **do not meet** — different address spelling, different case,
different zero-padding — and that is the failure that reads as a clean result.

Measured, caught by testing the join before wiring it up rather than after: one artifact spelled
addresses `0x00411460` (a shared normaliser), the consuming sweep keyed on the disassembler's
own rendering `00411460`. **134 keys on each side, intersection 0.** Every row would have
received no verdict, every proposal would have demoted for want of one, and the sweep would have
printed a healthy `0 repair, 146 abstain` — a census emptied by a string format, with no error
anywhere in the pipeline.

- **Assert the MATCH COUNT, not the presence of the table.** `matched == expected`, and say what
  a partial match means, because a partial match is two censuses drifting apart.
- **Normalise on BOTH sides through one function**, and reach for the project's existing
  normaliser. In this case its own docstring already named the failure — *"a lookup that silently
  misses and reads as no such function"* — in a module the call site had chosen not to import.

### The brackets that matter at the moment of a mutation are the ones nothing checks

Pre-flight tooling tends to grow around the **read-only** harness, because that is what runs every
pass. So the invariant constants inside *appliers* — the ones asserting the program's state
immediately before it is changed — are exactly the ones no routine check covers.

Measured: a pre-flight checker reported *"2 bracket constant(s) checked, 0 stale"* while **all five**
of a mutating applier's pre-state constants were stale by an intervening round's deltas. The
applier would have **refused** rather than mis-applied, so the design held; the defect is that the
staleness was invisible until a round happened to open the file.

- **Enumerate bracket constants across mutating scripts too**, or state in the checker's own output
  which population it covers, so "0 stale" cannot be read as "0 stale anywhere".
- **Re-pin with a named account, never by subtraction.** Each delta should cite the round that
  caused it and a committed artifact that corroborates it — `+188 symbols` is one round's applied
  names, checked both directions by the ledger gate; `+2 datatypes` are two placeholder structs
  named in that round's own record. A re-pin without that account is a re-baseline.


## A guard that succeeds destroys its own positive control

A probe that grades a guard cannot be calibrated on the guard's output. This sounds obvious
stated that way and is invisible in practice, because the calibration is usually written
*before* the guard works, when the thing it looks for is still there.

Measured. An exposure probe required a specific applied type name to be findable in a
committed evidence column — a drift a previous round had genuinely measured, so the
calibration was real when written. The producer of that column then gained a suppression
filter for exactly that class of name. From that moment the calibration could only fail: the
thing it looked for is the thing the producer now removes. It went unnoticed because the probe
was also raising for an unrelated reason, so nobody ever reached the calibration.

The obvious repair — point it at a *different* committed artifact whose whole job is naming
such types — also failed, and the failure is the general case: measured across **every**
committed column, once the guard worked, **no** column of that kind carried a qualifying name
except the handful the probe was there to report. A successful guard drives its own positive
control to zero everywhere.

So the control has to be **constructed**, and constructed controls have a failure mode of
their own:

- **Synthesise from real data through the real code path.** Take a genuine name from the
  ledger, render it in the actual format of each column being scanned, and run it through the
  same tokeniser and matcher the probe uses. A control that exercises a simplified path proves
  the simplified path works.
- **Make it TWO-SIDED.** A matcher that returns everything passes a positive-only check exactly
  as well as a correct one. Assert both that a real name IS found and that a name in no ledger
  is NOT — per scanned column, so the count is a fraction of the surface (`5/5 found, 5/5
  rejected`) rather than a bare "calibration ok".

And the diagnostic worth keeping: **when a calibration starts failing, ask whether the world
changed or the instrument did.** Here the world changed, correctly, in the direction the
project wanted — and the check that was supposed to notice regressions had been quietly
measuring a quantity that success was designed to eliminate.

## Three regex answers to one question means the question needs a parser

A completeness check that asks *"which scripts write a file?"* by pattern-matching source text
will be wrong, and widening the pattern is not the fix.

Measured on one project, on a single producer that had to be found:

- the check scanned with `os.listdir(dir)` rather than a walk, so an entire subdirectory —
  164 files, a third of the tree — did not exist to it;
- its write-pattern matched only the project's own two CSV helpers, missing a hand-rolled
  `csv.writer`;
- and the producer wrote as `import csv as _c` / `_c.writer(`, so **widening the pattern to
  `csv\.writer\(` still missed it.**

Three shots at the same question by pattern, three wrong answers — and the project already had
an AST-based resolver for exactly this question, written earlier *because three regex copies of
it had disagreed with each other*. Reuse it. An `ast` walk answers "does this module CALL this
method" without confusing a mention in a comment for a call, which the regex also got wrong in
the other direction.

**The corollary that bites during the fix:** an AST resolver honestly returns a *glob* when an
output filename is computed at runtime. Matching its answers against real filenames with a set
intersection then silently drops every such producer. Match with `fnmatch` when the name
carries a metacharacter — and note what surfaced this: the stale-entry arm had just been
changed from a `print` to a `raise`. **A note printed by a check nobody runs is not a signal.**

## A witness that agrees with BOTH hypotheses is not a witness for either

Auditing your witnesses for INDEPENDENCE is not the same as auditing them for DISCRIMINATING
POWER, and a round can do the first impeccably while skipping the second entirely.

Measured on a 1999 MSVC/x86 binary. A probe was written to decide whether 224 bodies at a
fixed vtable slot were the class's **vector** deleting destructor (`??_E`). Everything about
its design is right, and it is worth reading as a model:

- it opens by REFUSING to extend a 9-target claim to 203 on artifact-side evidence alone,
  on the stated grounds that the artifact-side observations "all reduce to *the vtable is
  shaped the way a destructor slot would be shaped*" and would be the project corroborating
  its own layout work;
- it names three BODY markers as the independent witness — the `__flags & 1` deallocation
  test, `RET 4`, and a call to the deallocator;
- and it **discovers the deallocator by counting callees rather than hardcoding an address**,
  explicitly so that "the leg that could most easily have been an assumption is instead a
  discovery confirmed by ground truth". One address was called by 224 of 224 bodies and only
  then looked up — it carried an export symbol, i.e. the binary's own statement.

It reported 224 of 224 on all three legs, and the round named 203 functions
`<Class>::vector_deleting_dtor`. **All 203 were wrong.** The three markers are carried by the
vector deleting destructor *and* by the scalar one (`??_G`) alike. The probe could only ever
confirm *"this is a deleting destructor"*; it was read as confirming *"this is the VECTOR
one"*. The discriminator is one instruction it never looked for: MSVC's deleting-destructor
flag byte has bit 1 (`& 2`) selecting the ARRAY path — read the element count the compiler
stored at `[this-4]`, destroy each element in a loop, free from `this-4`. The probe's matcher
accepted an immediate `1`/`0x1`; the string `2` appeared nowhere in it. Re-measured across all
258 named bodies afterwards: the array bit occurs **9 times**, in exactly the 9 the earlier
round had read by hand and named correctly. The split fell exactly on a round boundary, with
no round mixed — the signature of a LABEL being copied forward rather than a shape re-read.

**The check, and it costs one question.** Before adding a fourth corroborating leg, write down
the rival hypothesis and ask *which of my legs is FALSE under it*. If the answer is "none",
the round has no evidence for its claim at all, however many legs it has and however
independent they are of one another. Three witnesses that cannot separate H1 from H2 are not
three witnesses for H1; they are three witnesses for `H1 ∨ H2`, which is not what the name
being applied says.

Two things make this failure hard to see from inside, and both are worth designing against:

- **The evidence was recorded honestly and only the NAME overclaimed it.** Every one of the
  203 ledger rows gave its reason as "`& 1` flag test, RET 4 and a call to operator_delete" —
  a true statement that does not entail the name beside it. So the artifact was never lying,
  and no reader comparing the `reason` column against the evidence would find a discrepancy.
  **A row whose `reason` does not ENTAIL its `name` is a defect class worth a mechanical
  check**, and it is invisible to every check that grades reasons for truth.
- **"It keeps one vocabulary for one thing" is a reason to reuse a TOKEN, not evidence for the
  CLAIM the token makes.** The applying round gave exactly that as its justification, and it
  is a good answer to the half of the question it addresses (which of *our* names to use). It
  silently also answered the half it does not (which of two real things this *is*). Watch for
  a justification that is about your naming convention where the claim is about the binary.

**And the repair's guard must be TWO-SIDED, because a positive-only guard is the defect.** The
repairing apply asserted the array bit ABSENT on its targets — and FIRST asserted it PRESENT
on the 9 known-vector controls, refusing the whole run if the discriminator could not fire
where the array path had been read by hand. Prefer ground truth to constructed poison for
these arms: feeding the 9 genuine vectors to the "must not be a vector" rule and requiring all
9 rejected is exactly the arm the original probe never had, and it needs no fixture.

## A lesson you keep re-learning is a missing CHECK, not a missing note

Measured on a long-running project, by tagging its own lessons file — 192 blocks, 844 KB,
written faithfully round by round over months. How many blocks had to re-learn each theme:

| theme | blocks |
|---|---|
| something was stale (an artifact, a number, a note, an installed copy) | 59 |
| a count reported without the population it is a fraction of | 32 |
| a check that cannot fire, cannot fail, or grades nothing | 30 |
| a pattern, API or fact recalled instead of derived | 30 |
| a zero or a gap produced by the instrument, not the binary | 23 |
| the cascade reverting what was applied | 23 |
| our own applied work read back as independent evidence | 20 |

(Regexes over prose, overlapping, with 32% of blocks untagged — so every count is a floor.)

**These were all written down before they recurred.** Twice in one session, a lesson was
re-learned by the round *immediately after* the round that recorded it. That is the number
worth internalising: **writing a lesson down has a measurable failure rate**, and a lessons
file is the instrument that measures it.

So when a round ends with "we keep making this mistake", the productive question is not *how
do I write this more memorably* but **"what artifact join would have SEEN it?"** In this
project the things that actually stopped defects recurring were checks, not prose: a gate that
refused destructor names at vtable slot targets; a corpus query tool that *refuses* on a stale
stamp instead of documenting staleness.

**The worked example, because the shape generalises.** A round named 9 functions
`<Class>::vector_deleting_dtor` after reading their bodies. A later round applied the same token
to 203 more that were structurally different. Every one of the 212 rows was individually
well-evidenced and every gate stayed green for four months, because **no check compared rows
that SHARE A NAME against each other** — the defect lived in the vocabulary, where no per-row
check can reach. The join that finds it is small: *for every name token this project INVENTED
(the binary's own symbol table never spells it) that spans more than one round, require a
registered rule that all its rows satisfy.* On that binary the first clause gives 66 of 4678
tokens and the second cuts it to 10 — a reviewable population, not noise.

Three things made it a real gate rather than a gesture:

- **Validate it against the historical defect, not against a poison.** Replayed over the
  artifacts as they stood before the repair, it fires on exactly the offending row set. A poison
  you wrote to be caught proves far less.
- **Its population must depend only on committed inputs.** A draft also consulted a
  git-ignored export, which would have let the *scope of the check* drift with a cache. The
  weaker evidence moved into the ledger's `witness` column instead, where a reader can see it.
- **Join both directions and refuse on an empty population** — an unregistered token, a stale
  registration, a drifted count, and a population of zero all have to raise.

And when the recurring lesson genuinely is discoverability, prefer a tool that **recomputes and
writes nothing** to an index file. The same project's hand-written "current state" section sat
thirty-four versions behind the truth with accurate prose beside it; a derived query cannot go
stale, and a committed summary always can.

## A bound is not a discriminator — and passing the bound is not evidence about attribution

A containment check — *every recovered cell must lie inside the object's known size* — is a real
assertion. It fires on real data, it catches arithmetic that overruns, and it is worth writing.
It cannot catch a cell attributed to the **wrong, smaller** object, because such a cell is
comfortably inside the bound by construction.

Measured. A new witness followed constructor calls whose receiver resolved to `this + K` and
rebased the callee's cells by `K`. One body allocated a 0x134-byte block of its own, did
`LEA reg,[EAX+4]`, and built a four-element array inside *that* block: the receiver really was
`something + 4`, just not `this + 4`. The rebased cells reached offset 308 in a 1,124-byte class
and the containment check passed cleanly, as it always would — the misattributed object was
smaller than the one it was charged to.

What caught it was a human reading one promoted row that looked wrong (an offset of 4 in a class
whose base is 932 bytes), and that only happened because the rule **printed its promoted population
in full** instead of summarising it to a count. The eventual fix was a different question
altogether: not *"is this cell inside the object"* but *"is the tracker still on the object"* —
answered by counting how many times the tracker had been re-seeded onto an allocation result.

Two rules, and the second is the load-bearing one:

- **Ask what your check is a bound on, and what it is silent about.** A range check grades
  arithmetic. Attribution — *whose* object this is — is a separate claim and needs its own witness.
- **A rule that can promote can mis-promote, so print the promoted population in full.** With a few
  hundred rows the audit is free and happens by eye on every run, and it is the only thing that
  found this. A count would have said `360 sites` and been believed.

## A documented escape that requires hand-editing a constant is not implemented

A gate with a pinned census will, sooner or later, deadlock against the thing that produces its
input. The usual fix is an escape argument — a flag that downgrades one arm so the pipeline can
take one step and re-prime itself. Check that the escape can actually be *taken*.

Measured. A signature sweep pinned four censuses (A1–A4) and then joined against a probe's
artifact (A5). The probe built its population by reading the sweep's own output, so after an
apply that GREW the population neither could move first — documented, understood, and solved with
a `bootstrap` flag that downgraded A5. The flag was useless: **A4 raises before A5**, and a
bootstrap run abstains on every row *by construction*, so A4 failed against any pin describing
real verdicts. The only path through was: edit the pin to the abstain-everything value, run
bootstrap, re-prime the probe, run bare, edit the pin back.

That procedure works and is a trap. **A constant that must be edited back is one interrupted
session away from being committed as the gate** — after which it passes forever while grading a
state that only exists during a bootstrap.

The fix is not discipline, it is an assertion that knows which mode it is in: under the escape
flag, assert what the escape run *must* look like (here: every row abstains, checked against the
row count) rather than skipping the arm. That is strictly stronger than a skip and needs no edit.

**Test: can the documented recovery procedure be executed without modifying a checked-in
constant? If not, the procedure is a bug report about the gate.**

## Report the ROOT CAUSE of a dependency refusal, not the symptom

When a build has an ordering constraint, refusals get bucketed by the immediate blocker — "base
not built", "input missing", "dependency unresolved". That is true and nearly useless, because it
does not say whether the blocker is a *scheduling artefact* (it will build later, or on a second
pass) or a *hard block* (nothing can ever build it in its current state).

Measured. A struct-building wave refused 23 classes under `base_not_built:<X>`. Splitting the
bucket by *why* the base was unavailable — `base_unsized:<X>` (no decided size, so no prefix can
ever be flattened from it) versus `base_not_built:<X>` (buildable, just not yet) — turned 21 of
the 23 into a finding about three specific classes, one of which single-handedly blocked a
16-member family. The same 21 rows went from a wall to a backlog item with three names on it.

The refusal bucket is a report to a human who has to decide what to do next. **Bucket by the
cause they can act on, not by the check that happened to fire.**

## An invariant inferred from ONE observation is a coincidence with a raise attached

The dangerous moment is right after you fix a real defect. You have just watched the system do
something, you understand why it did it, and encoding "it must always do that" feels like
tightening the check. Sometimes it is; sometimes you have promoted an accident to a law.

Measured. A gate could not be passed without hand-editing its own pinned census — a genuine
defect, since a constant that must be edited back is one interrupted session away from being
committed as the gate. The fix asserted the observed behaviour: *under the escape flag, every row
abstains*. That was true of the run in front of it, and it was a property of one **stale cache**,
not of the escape. Two rounds later the cache was richer, rows legitimately carried verdicts, and
the assertion raised on a completely healthy run.

The contract being modelled was about **trust**, not values: the escape run's results are not to
be believed for any row, because the program moved underneath the artifact they were computed
from. There is no value-level invariant that expresses that. The honest encoding is a **loud
abstention** — announce that the arm did not grade and why — which still removes the hand-edit,
which was the actual defect.

Two rules:

- **Before asserting a newly-observed invariant, ask what would have to be true for it to hold
  next time.** If the answer names a cache, a version, or a population size, you are asserting a
  snapshot.
- **When the property you mean is about trust or provenance rather than values, do not
  manufacture a value check for it.** An arm that declines to grade, loudly, is a real control;
  an arm that grades the wrong thing is worse than no arm at all.

And the consolation, which is also the argument for writing checks early: **this one fired within
two rounds.** A false invariant that happens never to fire is indistinguishable from a true one,
and every round in between will have believed it. The cost here was one raise and one
adjudication.

## A producer that consumes another producer's artifact should assert the contradiction a stale input creates

Pipelines acquire ordering constraints quietly: sweep B reads sweep A's CSV, so B must run after
A. That order gets written in a comment, read once, and then violated the first time someone runs
the steps in a different sequence — usually right after an apply, when several artifacts are stale
at once and the obvious next command is the one that looks most relevant.

The failure is not that B crashes. It is that **B produces a plausible census from stale input**,
and a plausible census is indistinguishable from a correct one.

Measured. An applier repaired 18 signatures and appended them to its ledger. The consuming sweep
builds its "still blind" population by reading the *upstream* sweep's artifact, which had not been
regenerated yet — so 18 addresses were simultaneously in the still-blind set and in the applied
ledger. It raised with exactly that sentence: *"18 address(es) are BOTH still blind and in the
ledger, which cannot both be true."* One re-run in the right order fixed it, and nothing had to be
remembered.

**The rule: when a producer joins two artifacts that a mutation updates at different times, assert
the JOIN's contradiction, not the ordering.** "X cannot be in both sets" is a property of the data
that holds under every schedule; "run A before B" is a fact about the operator. The first fires
every time it is violated; the second is documentation.

## Two checks moving in OPPOSITE directions by the same amount is one account, not two problems

After a mutation, adjudicating pinned counts one at a time invites a re-pin per count and an
understanding of none. Look for the counts that move together first.

Measured. A signature apply gave two functions a sibling's stack parameters. Four pinned things
moved: an under-modelled candidate set 43 → 41, a control population 121 → 123, one verdicts CSV
68 → 66, one mismatch CSV 93 → 91. All four are the **same two functions** leaving the set whose
declared cleanup disagrees with its `RET` immediate and entering the set where they agree — which
is precisely what the repair was *for*. Two of the four moved down and one moved up, and that
opposition is the evidence they are one event.

Adjudicated separately, each would have read as an unexplained drift and earned its own
hand-waved re-pin. **Before re-pinning anything, list every count that moved and look for equal
and opposite pairs**: they usually name the population that crossed a boundary, and one sentence
then covers all of them.

## A vacuity guard belongs on the OUTPUT of a join, never on its inputs

The standing rule "every producer that emits a name column carries a ledger join, vacuity-guarded"
is easy to satisfy in a way that guards nothing. The guard gets written against the thing that is
convenient to check — *did the ledger file load?* — rather than the thing the column depends on:
*did a single one of its rows match?*

Measured, and it survived the whole life of the artifact. A sweep built its ledger set from a CSV
spelling addresses `0x004013a0` and looked them up with the disassembler's rendering, `004013a0`.
The intersection was **structurally empty**: raw 0 of 213, correctly keyed 213 of 213. So the
column that exists to distinguish *our own applied names* from *the binary's own statements* read
`non_AI` on every row ever committed, while **every** row was one this project had named. The
guard beside it — "the ledger is EMPTY, refusing to emit" — was green throughout, because 5,446
addresses had loaded perfectly. The file's header even claimed *"A1 asserts the join is
non-vacuous."* It asserted nothing of the kind, and the poison that "demonstrated" it had been
demonstrated against the input check.

Three things generalise:

- **Assert the join's cardinality, not its operands' cardinality.** `matched == 0` while both
  inputs are large is a key fault, never a finding about the program. Key it on emptiness rather
  than a threshold so the count is free to move as the project names and unnames things.
- **Prefer a poison that reinstates the REAL historical defect** over a constructed one. Re-keying
  the ledger the old way is a two-line poison that proves the new check catches the thing that
  actually happened, which a synthetic mutation only argues by analogy.
- **A dead discriminator column is CONSTANT, and that is an artifact-side detector costing one
  pass over the CSVs.** Sweeping every committed artifact for provenance-shaped columns taking
  exactly one value over ≥20 rows returned 9 candidates: 8 benign (populations *defined* by that
  column, plus one documented one-shot pre-apply harvest) and the 9th was the defect. It needs no
  disassembler and it fires on the pre-repair file.

**And the root cause was nonconformity, which is countable.** Of 70 address-shaped columns across
60 committed artifacts, 69 were `0x`-prefixed and **exactly one was bare hex** — the one whose join
died. Being the only artifact that spells a key differently is a standing hazard independent of any
particular consumer; it had already propagated into a second ledger (108 of 527 rows), where 13
addresses appeared under both spellings. Census the spellings once and the outlier names itself.

## A poison that changes nothing grades nothing — validate it by watching it refuse

A poison is only evidence if the run without it and the run with it *differ*. The failure mode is
writing a poison for a rule that is genuinely important, and never noticing the poison is inert
because the rule refutes nothing on the current population.

Measured. A pricing rule required that the *owner's* size contain the body's reach — a real
necessity, since "reaches past the declared type" is necessary but not sufficient. The poison
dropped that guard. The census came back **byte-identical** and the assertion stayed green: the
contradiction the rule exists to catch fires on **0 of 182** rows, so there was no row for the
removed guard to let through. Reasoning would not have found this — the rule *is* important and
the check *is* correct. Running it did.

Two consequences:

- **Replace an inert poison with one that manufactures the violation directly** (e.g. force the
  refused rows to the accepting verdict), so the assertion is exercised on rows that really do
  fail a witness.
- **PRINT the measured zero in the census instead of leaving it behind a green check.** A rule
  that refutes nothing *on this population* is a fact about the population, and a silent pass is
  how the next round inherits "that was checked" without ever learning it never bit.

Note also that a cross-check which re-derives from the columns will not catch *every* row a
verdict rejects — ours caught 67 of 68 — and that gap is a feature: it means the check is
independent of the refusal reason rather than a restatement of it.

## Two places answering one question differently: the inverse of "the gate ratifies the guess"

The familiar rule is that a generator and its gate must not read the same way, or the gate merely
confirms the guess. The inverse failure is less obvious and just as silent: **they read
*differently*, they disagree, and because the generator runs first the gate never sees the rows to
disagree about.**

Measured. A census script and the applier that consumes it both had to answer "does this class have
a struct?". The applier enumerated every type and keyed on the bare name — correct. The census
looked the type up in one category path — wrong for any struct the tool's demangler had created. So
the census refused 25 rows, the applier's guard would have admitted all 25, and the two never met:
the applier only ever sees rows the census already accepted. The population silently shrank and
every check stayed green.

The rule: **when two components answer the same question, either share the implementation or assert
they agree.** A shared helper is better, but an assertion is cheap — have the consumer re-derive the
predicate over the *rejected* rows too, and raise if it disagrees with the producer's verdict.
Whichever you choose, the thing to avoid is two independent implementations of one predicate where
only one of them can ever be observed.

## A poison whose premise the round itself retires must be REPLACED, not deleted

A poison arm encodes an assumption about what the round refuses. When a later round widens the
approval, some of those arms stop being able to fire — and a poison that cannot fire still *prints
as demonstrated* if nobody re-runs it against the new configuration.

Measured. One round split a population into risk classes and approved only the strongest; its
poison admitted a row from the excluded class to prove the guard refused it. The next round
approved that class. The poison would now inject a legitimately-approved row, the guard would
correctly stay green, and the arm would have looked exercised while grading nothing. It was
replaced with one that admits a row the census refused on a *witness* (a per-row precondition the
guard re-checks independently of the risk class), which is a property no widening of scope retires.

**Prefer poisons keyed to per-row preconditions over poisons keyed to population membership.**
Membership is what approvals change; preconditions are what the evidence actually rests on. And
when a round widens an approval, re-run every poison — that is the moment they go inert.

## An if/elif decomposition cannot fail its own sum check

A common repair, when a report is found printing hard-coded category counts beside a live total, is
to derive the categories and assert they sum to the total. Written the obvious way, that assertion
can never fire.

Measured. A tool printed `52 repairable, 28 sret, 36 stubs` — literals measured when the population
was 145 — beside a computed denominator that had since fallen to 91. The fix derived the six
categories from the committed artifacts and added *"raise if the parts do not sum to the whole"*.
But the derivation was an `if/elif` chain: each row tested in order, incremented into exactly one
bucket. **The parts then sum to the whole by construction**, and the reconciliation — the entire
point of the exercise — was unfireable, guarding precisely the drift it was written for.

Rewritten as **independent predicates evaluated over the whole population**, the sum becomes a real
statement: an overlap (a row matching two predicates) makes the parts exceed the total, and a gap
(a row matching none) leaves them short. That is what "these categories partition the population"
should mean, and only that form can be violated.

**And when the poison will not fire, do not weaken the poison — ask what property the check
actually has.** The first poison here gave a row a second category to force an overlap, and could
not fire: every fall-through predicate was guarded on "no verdict", so they were mutually exclusive
by construction whatever else changed. What the sum check really tested was **exhaustiveness** — an
unrecognised category value satisfies neither the named predicates nor the "no verdict" guards, so
the row lands nowhere and the parts fall short. Poisoning a valid value to an unknown one fires it.
The first poison's failure was the more useful result: it named the property.

## A stale count in a backlog does not merely fail to guide — it directs effort at nothing

The usual argument for deriving counts is that stale numbers mislead. The sharper cost is that a
stale *backlog* count advertises work that has already been done.

Measured. A tool's category line said "52 repairable" and had said so for nineteen program
versions. The project's own append-only ledger recorded the denominator falling 145 → 124 → 93 over
two of those versions, and **145 − 93 = 52** — the repairable rows had been repaired, and the line
survived them. A round was scoped from that number before anyone checked it.

Two defences, and the second is the one usually missing:

- **Derive the composition, not just the total.** A total that is computed beside categories that
  are literals is the worst of both: the freshness of the number lends credibility to the stale text
  beside it.
- **When a findings file's number is copied into a tool, the copy is the defect, not the file.** The
  findings file was correct — it recorded what was true when it was written, which is its job. Leave
  it as the historical record and add a dated correction; fix the *tool* to derive. A note that must
  be edited to stay true will go stale; one that is appended to stays current by construction.

## Stale PROPORTIONS are worse than a stale total, and a docstring is where they hide

When a report's headline number is computed but its accompanying breakdown is prose, the breakdown
rots faster than anyone notices — and it rots in the more dangerous direction.

Measured. A tool's help text described its largest denominator as *"1,771 is not 1,771 units of the
same work: ~588 are mechanical (429 of them one mechanical kind) and ~1,181 need a body read."*
Re-derived later, over a denominator that had fallen to 939: the mechanical kind was **111**, not
429 — three quarters of them had been named — and the body-read share was **452**, not ~1,181.

The asymmetry is the point. **A stale total is self-evidently dated and gets discounted; a stale
ratio reads as structure and gets trusted.** Someone scoping work would have dismissed "1,771" as
old and still planned against "429 of one kind" as the shape of the problem.

Two habits:

- **Derive the composition, not only the total.** A computed headline beside a hand-written
  breakdown is the worst arrangement: the freshness of the first lends credibility to the second.
- **Grep any prose that quotes measurements for multi-digit numbers, and ask of each one: is this a
  date, a cross-reference, or a fact that can move?** It takes seconds. Writing the correction for
  the case above, the live value got typed into the very paragraph explaining why live values must
  not be written down — twice, in two different paragraphs. That grep is what caught both.

Note also that a module docstring is often *published*: argparse and many CLI frameworks print it
as the program's help description, so "internal comment" is the wrong mental model for it.

## Not every decomposition can carry a sum check — say which, and guard what can actually fail

Having added a parts-sum-to-the-whole check to one derived breakdown, the instinct is to add it to
its siblings for symmetry. Sometimes it is unfireable there, and adding it is worse than omitting
it: a green check nobody can falsify reads as coverage.

The discriminator is where the categories come from:

- **An OPEN vocabulary can fail.** If buckets key on a status string read from another artifact, a
  value the code has never heard of satisfies no named predicate and no fall-through guard, so the
  row lands nowhere and the parts fall short. That is worth asserting, and it is what actually
  catches a new status appearing upstream.
- **Set algebra over one population cannot.** Buckets defined as `A-only`, `B-only`, `both`,
  `neither` partition their input by construction; the sum is a tautology.

Where the sum check would be a tautology, guard the failure that is real instead. For the case
above that was **a source artifact reading empty** — with no rows in one input, every row it would
have classified silently falls into the catch-all bucket and the population reads as far more
hand work than it is. That is the false-zero shape, it is one `if` away, and it is demonstrable.

**And put the reasoning in the code.** The next reader's instinct will also be symmetry; a comment
saying *why this one has no sum check, and what it has instead* is what stops the tautology being
added back.


## Run the poisons after the bare dry run is green, not beside it

A poison arm is graded by *which* check it fires, never by whether a traceback appeared. A poison
submitted in parallel with the first dry run of a new applier therefore proves nothing: if any
earlier check refuses for a real reason, every arm ends in that refusal's traceback, and the arm
that "fired" has not been demonstrated.

Measured twice in three rounds on one project. A census-drop poison meant to fire the population
pin fired the namespace check instead, because the owner class genuinely had no namespace; the
next round, both poisons of a rename applier fired its first check, because the program spelled
the targets without the namespace the census had rendered. In both cases the poisons were only
demonstrated on a second run, after the real refusal had been repaired — so the parallel
submission saved nothing and produced two tracebacks that read like demonstrations.

Sequence: bare dry run until it is green; then each poison, reading the check letter in the
exception; then apply. And when a first dry run refuses, treat it as the finding it is — three of
the four such refusals in that project were real conditions the applier's author had assumed away.


## A calibration whose FILTER and whose ASSERTION are the same quantity cannot fail

A new witness kind was introduced with what looked like a proper calibration: run the rule over
the classes whose size is already known independently, and require the result never to contradict
them. Written out, the first version was

```
floor = min(offset for offset in derived_writes if offset >= sizeof(base))
assert floor >= sizeof(base)
```

which is true by construction. It would have shipped green, and it would have protected nothing —
the population it ran over was real, the comparison was real, and the number it compared was the
one the filter had already guaranteed.

The repair is to feed the filter a DIFFERENT quantity from the one the assertion grades. Here the
filter took the base's own measured constructor write extent, and the assertion still compared
against the independently known `sizeof`; the two agree on healthy data and diverge exactly when
the rule is wrong. A poison that removes the filter then raises on committed bytes.

**When writing a calibration, say out loud where each number comes from.** If the filter and the
assertion trace to the same measurement, there is no check — only a restatement. The tell is that
you cannot describe a state of the world in which the assertion fails without also changing the
filter.

## Run a new witness over EVERYTHING it can reach, not only the rows it was built to close

A witness kind added to close an open population will, if you let it, also fire on rows that are
already decided by some other route. That overlap is the cheapest and most honest calibration
available, and it is the only one whose population was not chosen by the person writing the rule.

Measured on one project: a new size witness was built for the classes that had none, and running
it unrestricted also produced an answer for five classes already pinned by unrelated arithmetic.
It agreed with all five. The round's *declared* calibration was three comparisons; this
undesigned one was five, on rows the author had no hand in selecting.

Two conditions make it usable, and both are cheap:

- **Do not restrict the new rule to the open rows.** The instinct is to scope it to the problem
  it was written for, which throws the overlap away.
- **Print the comparison as a first-class result**, including the case where nothing overlaps —
  a witness that can reach no already-decided row has no free calibration and should say so
  rather than appearing to have passed one.

And when the overlap agrees, **do not let the new witness take the row.** See the note on new
values in a gated column: relabelling an already-decided row can silently remove it from a
downstream channel. Record the agreement in the row's own note instead, where it reads as the
corroboration it is rather than as the provenance it is not.

## An assertion is demonstrated by breaking the INPUT; a test is demonstrated by breaking the CODE

These are two different obligations, and holding only the first lets a poison arm pass while
grading nothing.

The familiar discipline is: feed the check deliberately broken *data* and watch it fire. That
proves the check can fire. It does not prove the check is **positioned where the defect would
be** — because a check reached only after some earlier rule has already settled the same row
will pass its data-poison and still be blind to the bug it names.

Measured on one project. A new rule promoted an allocation to an exact size when the factory
body's write set was empty; the discriminator was deliberately the write **set** rather than the
route **label** the producer derives from it, because a third idiom can make the two disagree.
The poison arm constructed exactly that disagreement on a real body — relabel the route, leave
the six measured stores alone, require the refusal — and it passed. Then the *decider* was
mutated, replacing the write-set test with the label test, i.e. injecting the precise defect the
arm exists to catch: **every check still passed.**

The reason was positional, not logical. That body's independently measured floor already equalled
its allocation, so an earlier sandwich rule pinned the row before either version of the new rule
was consulted. With the row already decided, both discriminators were skipped and the arm could
not observe which one the code used. The arm named the write set and could not see it.

The repair was to the **fixture**, not to the assertion: lower the floor so an interval survives,
and the new rule actually gets the chance to decide — at which point the label version takes it
(wrongly) and the set version refuses. Both mutations are caught now.

**The rule to carry:**

- When a rule sits behind earlier rules that can decide the same row, its poison fixture must
  **open the decision** those rules would close. Otherwise the arm grades an unreachable branch.
- **Mutate the code, not just the data, at least once per new rule.** Replace the rule's
  discriminator with the wrong one that would look right, and require some arm to fail. It is a
  few minutes and it is the only thing that tests the test.
- A useful pairing: one mutation that makes the rule read the *wrong evidence*, and one that
  deletes the rule's *reporting*. The second usually fails loudly; the first is the one that
  slips through.

## A guard whose only effect is an absence cannot be seen to work

A refusal that manifests as "the row simply did not match" is indistinguishable from the row not
qualifying, and a clean run then reads as a passed test when nothing was tested.

Where a guard exists to protect against a condition **not present in the current data** — which is
the normal case for a guard added against a known-possible-but-unobserved idiom — make it *print*:
name the row, the measured evidence, and the fact that the decision was refused. And print the
unfireability explicitly on clean data, in words, e.g. *"X and Y agree on all N, so this guard is
UNFIREABLE against this data and a clean run is NOT a passed test."*

Then add the **negative twin**: assert the report does **not** fire on unpoisoned input. Without
it, a report that fired unconditionally would satisfy the poison arm regardless of the poison —
the same failure one level up.

## Calibrate a proposed witness BEFORE building it — the calibration is cheaper than the rule

A new witness kind arrives as a plausible statement about the compiler. The temptation is to
implement it, then calibrate. Reverse that: **grade the proposed rule, by hand, against the cases
where the answer is already known, before writing any of it.**

Worked example. Proposed: *"where a derived class's serialisation record sequence begins with its
base's and adds more, the offset of the first extra record is an upper bound on `sizeof(base)`."*
It looked strong — 12 qualifying pairs in a committed artifact, and it would have supplied exactly
the missing bound. Grading it against the pairs whose base already has a decided size took one
script and about ten minutes:

| pairs | verdict |
|---|---|
| 6 | exact hit |
| 2 | valid but loose (12 and 16 bytes) |
| **2** | **VIOLATION — the bound was BELOW the base's known size** |

The mechanism behind the violations: a derived class freely serialises a base member the base's own
`Save` skips. Both offending children wrote at 112, inside a base of 128, in the gaps its own
records leave.

A refinement ("only count an extra record beyond the base's *entire* serialised footprint") removed
both violations — **and removed every row that had made the rule look calibrated**, leaving two base
classes of support. That is the second half of the lesson: when a repair to a rule also destroys its
evidence base, the rule was fitted to its examples.

**Why the ordering matters more for an UPPER bound than a lower one.** A loose lower bound wastes a
round. A wrong upper bound *pins a size*, and every later round treats a pinned size as evidence.
The whole cost of not shipping this one was doing the arithmetic in the right order.

## A poison that fires the WRONG guard is mis-aimed — do not relax the guard that fired

Two of nine new poison arms raised a different exception than predicted. Both times the guard that
fired was right and the expectation was wrong:

- An arm meant to test a **scope** check ("only the approved row may move") instead fired the
  **ranking** check. Cause: the poisoned edge still perturbed its row (an `observed_ancestors`
  count rose), so it *did* count as moved and passed the scope arm — which is precisely why the two
  are separate checks rather than one. The arm was re-aimed at the ranking marker.
- An arm meant to test a **shared-body witness**, poisoned by retargeting three vtable slots in the
  input artifact, instead fired an **ambiguity** guard: the retarget also dropped slot agreement to
  a margin of 2. Correct behaviour, grading a different claim. Re-poisoned in the *derived* data
  structure instead — a third table given the three bodies — leaving agreement and ranking
  untouched, so the arm isolates the one property it names.

**The rule.** A poison firing an unexpected guard is a finding about your test, not about your
code. The reflex to avoid is loosening the guard that fired so the intended one can be reached:
that trades a working check for a demonstrated one. Re-aim the poison at the narrowest input that
produces *only* the state under test — often a derived structure rather than the source artifact,
precisely because an artifact edit perturbs several measures at once.

## A conservation check recomputed from the post-state conserves nothing

An applier asserted, after mutating: `components == prefix + own + extras`, where `extras` was the
set of unplanned-but-tolerated components **recomputed from the post-apply object**.

Drop a component and `extras` loses it too. The identity balances. The check passes. It has the
shape of a conservation law — a count on the left, a sum of parts on the right — and it is a
tautology, because both sides are derived from the same post-state. The one thing it existed to
notice, a component going missing, is precisely what it cannot see.

**The rule: a conservation check must compare against a value captured BEFORE the mutation.** Not
recounted after it. The repair here was to record, at precondition time, exactly which components
the apply intended to carry forward, and assert each one is still present afterwards — three lines
that turn a tautology into a check.

**The tell is syntactic and worth grepping for**: in any post-mutation assertion, look at where
each side of the comparison comes from. If both are read out of the object you just mutated, the
assertion is describing that object to itself. A pre-state snapshot, a committed artifact, or a
literal are the three things that make it real.

## The guard that stops your round is usually telling you something true

A precondition refused with what read like a stale complaint — the object *"matches neither the
fresh placeholder nor the plan"* — and the round's whole goal lay on the other side of it. The
tempting reading is that the check has drifted and needs relaxing.

It had not. It was the only thing preventing an apply from destroying a component another round had
written three versions earlier, and the correct response was to make the **apply** safe rather than
the **check** permissive.

**The rule: when a gate blocks the thing you came to do, work out what it is protecting before you
touch its condition.** Two questions settle it quickly — *what state would make this pass?* and
*what would happen if it did?* If the answer to the second is "the mutation proceeds and something
is lost", the gate is load-bearing and the round has just found its real subject. Relaxing a
condition to reach a goal is the single easiest way to turn a working check into a decorative one,
and it never looks like a regression at the time: the round completes, the gate is green, and the
guarantee is gone.

- **Calibrate on a REPLAYED PRIOR TREE rather than a constructed poison, wherever the project's
  own history offers one.** A constructed poison shows that a check *can* fire; replaying the
  state of the world before a known discovery shows that it finds *the thing it exists to find*.
  Measured: a sweep for missed inheritance edges was graded by removing one known edge from an
  in-memory copy of the hierarchy — the tree exactly as it stood before the round that found it —
  and requiring the sweep to rediscover it, with the negative arm that a *recorded* edge must not
  be reported as a candidate. That pair is stronger than any poison, costs a dict copy, and it
  stays honest as the project grows because the known answer is real.
- **Print the INPUT beside the verdict in any decoder you are debugging, or a bad read and a bad
  rule are indistinguishable.** Measured: an instruction decoder failed, was repaired, and failed
  again for a *different* reason introduced by the repair — identical symptom both times (every
  candidate classified "no"). What separated them was one line dumping the raw bytes next to the
  decision: the second run showed **correct bytes and a wrong answer**, which cannot be a read
  failure. A bare pass/fail counter would have sent the next hour back to the read.
- **A fix and a regression can land in the same patch.** In that same repair, guarding an array
  read with `for st in range(0, lead - 2)` looked like the safe bound and silently excluded
  `st == lead-2`, which was exactly the commonest case. Rehearse after every patch, not after
  every *session* of patches; the rehearsal is what attributes a failure to the change that
  caused it.

- **A POISON'S PAYLOAD CAN SATISFY THE VERY PREDICATE IT EXISTS TO VIOLATE, AND ONLY RUNNING IT
  SAYS SO.** Measured: a guard required a "this came from the binary" claim to cite a mangled
  symbol, i.e. to contain `@@`. Its poison arm asserted the claim with no such citation and its
  text read *"forced to prove the guard fires, no `@@` here"* — which **contains** `@@`. The arm
  passed, and the only reason anyone knew was that the script raised `POISON RUN PASSED` instead
  of silently going green. Two rules follow: write the "did the poison fire?" check as loudly as
  the guard itself, and **read your poison's payload as data the predicate will see**, not as
  prose describing what it means.
- **A GUARD THAT FIRES ON THE REAL CENSUS BEFORE IT FIRES ON ANY POISON IS BETTER EVIDENCE THAN
  THE POISON.** The same round's provenance guard refused a genuine row whose marker opened with a
  parenthesis instead of the exact token. A constructed arm proves the branch is reachable; a live
  refusal proves the guard is calibrated against the data it will actually see. Design the check so
  the honest rows must satisfy it, and treat the first real refusal as the demonstration.
- **AN ABSOLUTE BRACKET EARNS ITS KEEP ON ARITHMETIC, NOT ONLY ON COLLATERAL DAMAGE.** Same round:
  a struct's component count was pinned at 19 from counting the rows of a printed type listing; the
  struct has 18, because one field is an 8-byte `T[2]` occupying a single component. The guard
  refused in a dry run and cost a minute. The same slip inside a rename loop shifts every field
  after that offset, silently.

## A NARROWING can silently kill a poison — the first unfireable check caused by a FIX

Every other entry in this catalogue describes a check that was never able to fire, or that went
inert through drift. This one was made unfireable **by a correct repair**, in the same commit that
made the check right.

Measured: a probe's population was narrowed from all `(table, slot)` pairs to the class's own
destructor slot — a fix that removed 98.7% of the pairs and was demonstrably right. Its poison arm
injected the contradiction at slot **999**, chosen precisely because no real row lives there. The
new scope filters slot 999 out. **The arm went QUIET: it did not fail, it stopped being able to
fail**, and the suite stayed green.

The rule: **whenever a check's population is narrowed, re-run every poison that depended on the
width you removed.** A poison is a claim about the check's *reach* as much as about its predicate,
and a narrowing invalidates reach claims by construction. Repair the arm by injecting inside the
new scope — here, at the class's own destructor slot — so the poison rides the same filter as the
data.

Two corollaries worth carrying:

- **The narrowing and its poison repair belong in one commit.** Split across two, the interval
  between them is a green suite with a dead arm and nothing recording that.
- **A suite that prints per-arm outcomes catches this; one that prints a pass count does not.**
  A quiet arm and a passing arm are the same number.

## A poison written from an EXPECTATION is a hypothesis — run it before you believe the arm

The catalogue above is full of checks that could not fire. This is the cheapest way to avoid
adding another, and it costs one run: **a poison whose comment says the check "MUST then raise" is
a claim, and until it has been executed it is exactly as trustworthy as any other unmeasured
claim.**

Measured: a new sweep's population filter had a poison arm that dropped it, with the header
asserting the bound calibration would fire. It did not. The arm reported `416 cells over 13
exactly-sized classes, 0 violations` with the filter both on and off — because those 13 classes,
the only ones with an independently known size, had **zero** exclusions between them. The poison
could not reach the calibration's population at all.

The filter was not inert: dropping it added 157 bodies, 329 cells and 51 emitted rows. So the
situation was the awkward one — **a rule that changes the output and that no check can grade.**

Two responses, and only one of them is honest:

- **Wrong:** hunt for a check the poison does happen to fire, and ship the pair as if the rule
  were demonstrated. That manufactures a green arm for a rule that remains untested.
- **Right:** record that the rule is retained **on its argument, not on a demonstration**, name
  what would close it (here: a class with an independently known size that also has a
  cross-chain body — currently an empty set), and put it in the blind-spot backlog. The header
  comment then says the poison raises nothing, so the next reader is not misled by an arm that
  looks like coverage.

The general form: **a poison tests the check, and a poison that cannot reach the check's
population tests nothing.** Before writing one, ask which rows the check actually grades, and
whether your injected defect lands among them.

## A pin carries its POPULATION and its UNIT, or the next person cannot adjudicate it

A pinned count is an adjudication deferred to the future, and it only works if the future can tell
a real change from a change of unit. Measured: a disagreement count was pinned at **2** from a
pricing probe that counted per *instruction site*, and the producer built from that probe raised
at **1**, because it merged its evidence by `(class, offset)` before grading. One disagreement,
two correct numbers, and the refusal read exactly like a regression.

Re-deriving the pin to 1 was legitimate — the unit changed and that was established *before* the
number moved — but only because it could be established at all. Write into the constant's comment:

- **what population it is over** ("cells in the own window of classes that already carry committed
  rows"),
- **what unit it counts** ("cells, merged across sites — the pricing probe's per-site figure for
  the same disagreement is 2"),
- **and what the disagreement actually is**, concretely enough to re-check: the address, the
  instruction, and which of the two sides is believed wrong.

Then the rule that follows has teeth: **a change in this number is adjudicated in a round, never
re-pinned to make a run go green.**

## Adding a SOURCE to a union: seed the fixture EMPTY

When a denominator reads a union of artifacts and you add one, the selftest fixture is where the
round quietly becomes a rewrite. Seed the new source with data and every existing arm's literal
expectation moves — so the arms that exist to police the denominator all have to be re-derived in
the same commit that changes it, and afterwards nothing distinguishes a correctly re-derived
literal from a wrong one.

Seed it **empty** instead: a header row and no data. Every pre-existing arm keeps its exact
expectation and stays a real test of the change. Then give the new source its own arms on its own
private fixture — a class that no other artifact lays out, so a row can demonstrably move it out
of the zero-coverage set — plus:

- a **two-step baseline**: an environment variable that restores the previous source list exactly,
  so the old numbers are re-derivable from the new binary rather than remembered;
- a **poison per admission rule** the new source needs (a row of the wrong kind, a key that does
  not resolve, a duplicate);
- a **missing-file arm**, if the loader treats a missing artifact as an error rather than as an
  empty list — this proves the new source is inside that guarantee rather than beside it.

And if the source list is sliced positionally anywhere (`SOURCES[:4]` for an older baseline),
**append, never insert**, and say so in a comment above the tuple: an insertion silently redefines
what every earlier baseline means.

## An OPT-IN part is an unexercised part — and cost is what puts the switch there

A check can be unfireable because of its predicate, because of drift, or because of a repair (all
catalogued above). This is the fourth way, and it is the easiest to rationalise: **the part that
holds the check is behind a flag, because running it is expensive.**

Measured: a census carried five calibrations. One of them was the only arm grading its
inlined-helper detector, and that detector lived in a part that was **opt-in**, because its
byte-search matcher rescanned from every hit and a default run had been cancelled at 18, 6 and 13
minutes. So the switch went in for a good reason, and the arm went quiet for the same reason. The
detector then could not find its own known positive *at all* — two independent defects — and nobody
learned, because the arm that would have said so only ran when someone typed an extra word. The
census as a whole was in no gate list either, so the default run asserted four things and the fifth
was simply never asked.

Two rules, and the second is the one that actually fixes it:

- **A flag that gates a calibration is a calibration that does not exist.** If a part must be
  optional, its arms must still run — on a sample, on a fixture, on one known positive — or the
  suite must report the arm as NOT EXERCISED in its headline, loudly enough that a reader does not
  count it.
- **Fix the cost, not the coverage.** The expensive algorithm here was a byte search; the question
  it answered did not need one, and a single linear pass made the part cheap enough to run by
  default. Reaching for the flag is the reflex; asking why the check is expensive is the repair.
  A part that runs every time is worth more than a part that is thorough when invoked.

## A scope test keyed on the CANDIDATE SET silently inherits the candidate filters

The mirror image of the docstring-scope lesson above. There the comment claimed a restriction the
code did not implement; here the code's restriction was real but **derived from something
unrelated**, so it moved whenever that other thing moved.

Measured: a detector classified each hit as *"inside a sibling copy of this helper"* by asking
whether the function containing the hit was itself a **candidate** with the same signature. The
helper had **six** compiled copies; the sixth was two instructions longer than the rest, fell
outside the candidate size filter, and so was not recognised as a copy — its own body was counted
as an **inline site** of the other five. Nothing was wrong with either filter on its own.

The rule: **a classification test must be keyed on the property it is about, over the population it
is about.** "Is this function a copy of that helper?" is a question about every function small
enough to be one, not about the ones that happened to survive an unrelated eligibility filter.
Build the classification index separately, and if that means a second pass, take the second pass.
The tell is a test whose population is defined by an earlier `continue`.

## A witness COUNT is corroboration only if the witnesses are independent of the same defect

A confidence column that promotes a row from `single_witness` to `corroborated` on the strength of
*how many* witnesses agree is measuring agreement, not independence. A systematic error produces
agreement for free.

Measured: a scanner misattributed the first fields of a freshly allocated object to the enclosing
class. Seven sibling member bodies of that class each allocate and initialise such an object, so the
same wrong cells appeared **seven times** — and would have been recorded as well-corroborated rather
than as one defect seen seven ways. The repetition came from the compiler emitting the same idiom in
seven places, which is exactly the thing that makes a false row look strong.

So when defining corroboration, say what the witnesses must be independent OF:

- **not the same instruction** (the trivial case most projects already guard);
- **not the same body**, if the rule can fire twice in one function;
- **not the same idiom in sibling bodies**, when the population is a family the compiler generated
  from one source pattern;
- and **not the same instrument defect** — two witnesses produced by one scanner sharing one bug are
  one witness.

The practical form: prefer corroboration across **witness KINDS** (a constructor write and a
serialisation record and an accessor) over corroboration across **sites of one kind**, and when you
do count sites, record the kind beside the count so a later round can tell which sort of agreement it
is looking at.

## A lost WITNESS is graded by the direction it bounds, not by its absence

A repair to a producer will delete evidence as well as add it, and the reflex — find out why each row
went — is usually the wrong spend. Measured: repairing a scanner removed five rows of one witness
kind from a size-evidence artifact. The kind was an **upper** bound derived from exactly the data the
defect had corrupted, so its disappearance was the repair working; reading five constructors to
confirm that would have explained a witness that decided nothing.

The question that settles it in one join is **"did anything get worse?"**, asked of the decisions the
witness feeds:

- was any decided value LOST (a class that had a size and now has none)?
- did any bound move the WRONG way (an upper bound up, a lower bound down)?
- did any confidence DOWNGRADE?

Three zeroes and the loss is recorded and dropped. One non-zero and it is the round's headline.
Grade the consequence, not the row — and say in the write-up that you did, so the next reader knows
the five were counted rather than missed.

## An INERT diff is still an adjudication

A regeneration that changes an artifact without changing any decision still has to be written down.
Measured: five rows of one file moved in a single column that records how far a scan reached; every
one of those rows carried a refusal verdict for an unrelated reason, and not one verdict moved.

The reason to record it is not bookkeeping. A stability check hands you a list of files that differ,
and an entry nobody explained is **indistinguishable from damage** — so the next person either
re-derives it from scratch or, worse, learns to skim the list. *"It looked harmless"* is not a record;
*"column X only, N rows, no verdict moved"* is, and it costs one line.

---

## A raise can be RIGHT while the claim behind it is WRONG — and that is the only way a mis-stated assertion gets found

The failure this file mostly guards is the assertion that cannot fire. There is an inverse, and it
is worth writing an assertion tightly enough to meet it.

Measured: an arm of a read-only census was written to assert a specific predicted defect — *"this
class pins at 96 under the current scanner and 100 with the proposed change"* — and it **raised on
the first run against the real program.** The prediction came from reading ONE constructor and
assuming it was *the* constructor. There were four, and one of them wrote the class's last field
directly, so the class-level maximum concealed the defect entirely.

The assertion was not wrong about the program. It was reporting that **the specification was wrong**,
and rewriting the arm to measure what was actually there — that the decided size depended on *which
overload* a route happened to name, giving 32, 60, 96 or 100 — produced a sharper defect than the one
predicted, and one nobody was looking for.

Two rules follow:

- **State the mechanism in the assertion's own message, not just the threshold.** The message that
  fired named the two numbers it expected and the body it had read them from, which is what made the
  diagnosis one function-read long. A message saying only *"expected a difference, found none"* would
  have been read as noise and the arm loosened.
- **When an arm fires on a state you believe is healthy, suspect the specification before loosening
  the arm.** The cheap move is to widen the tolerance until it passes; the arm then measures nothing
  and the finding is gone. Ask instead what the program is doing that the assertion did not
  anticipate — that difference is the result.

## Prefer an already-DECIDED population over a constructed poison

Before writing a poison, look for rows some other channel has already decided, and check whether the
new rule's output is *bounded* by them. It usually is, and the test is then free.

Measured: a newly proposed constructor-discovery route reached 27 classes, and **21 of them already
carried a decided size from an unrelated allocation-site witness.** A constructor's write extent is a
LOWER bound on its class's size, so `extent <= sizeof` is an immediate test on every one — and 7 of
the 17 it could grade failed it, refuting the route before a single row was written. The same
population then graded the accepted repair *positively*: under the fix, a class reproduced the exact
size the other channel had decided; without the fix it decided nothing.

This is strictly better than a poison in three ways: it is real data rather than constructed input,
it grades in both directions (refutation and confirmation), and it cannot be satisfied by the rule
under test because the rule had no access to it. Keep the poisons for the raises that no existing
population can exercise. And state the graded count as a fraction of the calibration population —
"0 violations over 12 graded" and "0 violations over 17 graded" are different results, and a
narrowing that clears the calibration by *shrinking* it has not cleared anything.

---

## REWRITING A CHECK DATES ITS POISON — and the abort is silent about what it takes down

A poison arm names the check it breaks, usually by matching a substring of that check's message.
**Changing the message is changing the poison's subject**, exactly as changing code dates a
comment, and it is easy to do while believing you have improved the check.

Measured. A round replaced a raise (*"this hub already carries a call-edge row"*) with a
different one guarding a different property, and did not revisit the arm that poisoned it. The
arm went on firing — **on the new check, under the old marker** — so the harness correctly
reported `fired on the WRONG check` and **aborted the whole run**. Five further arms after it
never executed. The suite exited 1 for three rounds with nothing reading it, and its output said
only that *one* arm had failed: **nothing announced that six of eleven arms had gone dark.**

Two rules follow:

- **When you rewrite a raise, grep for its message text before you finish.** The poison that
  names it is usually the only other place the sentence appears.
- **A harness that aborts on a mis-fired arm must say how many arms it did not reach.**
  `FAIL ... fired on the WRONG check` reads like one failure and was six. Print
  `ran N of M declared` and derive M from the source rather than a literal, so the gap is
  visible without anyone counting.

## A SELF-CHECK NOTHING INVOKES IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM ONE THAT DOES NOT EXIST — second instance

This file already records the pattern. Here is what it cost the second time: **two** test
harnesses were exiting 1 simultaneously, for three consecutive rounds, while every declared gate
stayed green and two of those rounds regenerated the very artifact the suites check.

The instructive half is the *other* harness, because it was working perfectly. Its check asserts
a SET of class names rather than a count — written that way on purpose, with a comment saying a
count going stale is exactly how the check had stopped meaning anything, since a fifth class
appearing and a listed one vanishing would still read as "4". It caught a legitimate new member
of that set **in the round that added it**, and reported it three rounds later, because nobody
ran the file. **A check's quality is bounded by its invocation, not by its design**, and the
repair is never another check: it is adding the existing one to whatever list a round is
actually required to run.

## GRADE A POISON ON THE POPULATION THE RULE FIRES ON, NOT THE ONE YOU HAVE HANDY

A poison that runs against the wrong population passes vacuously and certifies nothing.
Measured: a guard was demonstrated load-bearing on a 98-pair calibration population (5
mispredictions without it) and **entirely vacuous** on the 44-edge population the adjudicator
actually iterates — dropping it there changed nothing at all. Both facts are true; only one of
them is about the code that ships. State which population an arm graded on, and when a rule has
two populations (one it is calibrated on, one it fires on) give it an arm on each.

---

## A GUARD THAT PROTECTS ONE LIST CAN MAKE A CHECK THAT READS BOTH GO VACUOUS

Measured. A scanner produced two parallel lists of the same events under different rules: a
strict one and a permissive one. The permissive list carried a guard excluding records reached
through a call return; the strict list carried no equivalent. A downstream trust check read
**both**: it took its anchor from the last record of the strict list, then quantified over the
permissive list's entries at or after that anchor.

On a contaminated body the guard had already removed exactly those entries, so the quantifier ran
over an **empty set** and the check returned True — while its anchor named the wrong class
entirely. The alternative, stricter rule refused correctly.

Neither guard is wrong in isolation. **When two collections are filtered by different rules and
one check reads both, the check's real population is the intersection, and the intersection can be
empty on precisely the inputs the check exists for.** Write the arm that pins that population
non-empty, and put the count in the output.

## A CHECK THAT COMPARES A FILTER'S LENGTH TO ITS SOURCE CANNOT FIRE

Caught in this document's own author's code before it was believed: `if len(filtered) > len(source)`
where `filtered` was built by filtering `source`. True by construction, therefore never a check.

The replacement was the real precondition — every record's epoch label must be one of the events
the same scan recorded, so an unrecognised label makes the classification unsupported rather than
merely unusual — and it is demonstrated by a poison that rewrites one label to a value no event
has.

**The tell is that the poison is hard to write.** If you cannot construct an input that breaks the
check, it is not a check. Reach for that test *while* writing the assertion, not afterwards.

## AN EXCLUSION IS A CLAIM ABOUT THE WORLD AND IS CHECKED LIKE ONE

A stability harness re-runs every producer and byte-compares its output, with a registry of
artifacts excused from that comparison and a reason for each. A new census artifact was registered
as excused on the reasoning that regenerating it would repeat an expensive scan.

The confirming pass **refused**: the probe that produces it was already registered to run every
pass, so the file was written *during* the pass, and the harness's own words for the exclusion
were *"a comment claiming otherwise."* It was right, and the entry was deleted — a probe that
emits an artifact puts that artifact in the comparison for free, so the cost the exclusion was
avoiding did not exist.

Build the arm that checks whether each excused artifact is in fact still unregenerated. An
exclusion that has quietly become false is worse than no exclusion: it reads as a considered
decision while hiding a comparison nobody is making.

## A DIFFERENTIAL THAT TAKES ONE ARM FROM A DEFAULT IS DELETED BY THE NEXT DEFAULT CHANGE

A probe compared a scanner's behaviour with a new flag on and off:

```
a = scan_body(...)                              # the old behaviour, via the default
b = scan_body(..., new_flag=True)               # the new behaviour
```

Correct, readable, and it measured the thing. Then the same round used that measurement to license
**flipping the default** — at which point both arms became the new behaviour, the probe compared
an arm against itself, and it would have kept printing `202 of 202 identical` **forever**. A green
that can never go red again, installed by the very change it was meant to license, and nothing
anywhere would have reported it.

**Pin every arm of a differential to a literal, never to a default**, and treat "the default is
about to change" as the routine case rather than the exotic one — a successful differential is
precisely the thing that causes a default to change, so the two events are correlated, not
independent.

## WHEN THE FINDING IS AN ABSENCE, THE FIXTURE MUST COME FROM SOMEWHERE THE PRESENCE IS KNOWN

A probe whose entire output is a zero is the easiest result for a dead instrument to produce, and
the population under test cannot supply the fixture — the population is *where the answer is zero*.
Two arms are needed, and both must raise rather than print:

- **A reach denominator.** State how many of the compared units actually exercise the mechanism.
  Measured here: the tracker under test is constructed only *by* an allocator call, so a body
  calling none never reaches the flag at all; folding those into "identical under both arms" would
  report **vacuity as coverage**. 202 of 202 did call one, so the equality was coverage. Zero
  raises.
- **A positive control on a DIFFERENT unit.** Find a case the documentation or an earlier round
  records as exhibiting the effect, and show the same comparison shape detects it. Here the
  module's own documented worked case yields **9** sub-object calls with the rule and **7**
  without — the two loops that rule was written to recover. A non-positive difference raises,
  because it means the comparison cannot see the effect it is reporting absent.

With both, "we measured zero" becomes a claim about the binary. Without them it is a claim about
the probe, and the two are indistinguishable in the output.

## LAND A LATENT REPAIR WHOSE NO-OP IS PROVEN — but in this order

A defect can be real in the code and have zero consequence in the artifact you happen to be
working on. That is not a reason to leave it: a documented module-wide switch silently disabled for
one whole mode is waiting for the next input that needs it. The order is what makes it safe:

1. Add the behaviour as a parameter **defaulting to the existing behaviour**, so every caller is
   byte-identical *by construction* rather than by a diff someone has to read.
2. Run the differential over the real population, with the reach denominator and positive control
   above.
3. Only then flip the default.
4. Only then run the whole-tree comparison, which now means something — it is confirming a
   prediction rather than observing that nothing happened.

Reversing steps 3 and 4 makes the final green indistinguishable from having changed nothing at
all. **The differential is the licence; the tree comparison is the confirmation.** Keep the old
behaviour reachable as the differential's legacy arm afterwards.

## A TEST HARNESS THAT FAKES THE DISASSEMBLER IS A SECOND IMPLEMENTATION — calibrate it or the arms are fiction

A shared scan library sat behind twelve producers with four behaviour switches and **no test file
at all**, because it takes a live program object. The fix is a fake: the library touches a small,
bounded slice of the API — a function's instructions, and per instruction an address, a mnemonic,
operand text, scalars, a flow type, flow targets, written registers and p-code. Fifteen methods.
Fed the same rendered text the disassembly stream already carries, a real body replays verbatim
and the PRODUCTION code runs against it.

**The scanner is then not the risk; the fake is.** Measured: **all eighteen arms passed while the
fake reproduced only 65 of 252 real bodies — 25.8%.** One method was wrong. `getResultObjects()`
returned operand 0 for every form, so `TEST reg,reg` — the null check emitted after every
allocation — was reported as *writing* that register, and the alias tracker destroyed the alias
the allocation had just established. Every factory-shaped body lost its cell channel from that
instruction on. After the fix: 252 of 252.

Note what the fake's p-code method is: a hand-written mnemonic list answering "does this
instruction write memory" — **exactly** the thing the library under test records having tried and
abandoned, because it *"disagreed with the spec on 70 of 2221 cases"*. The list is admissible only
with a replay bounding it.

So: **capture real outputs for real inputs, replay them through the fake, and state the agreement
as a fraction.** Treat a passing arm as evidence about the arm and never about the fake. And make
the fidelity check impossible to skip — a missing fixture should be a refusal, not a pass, because
a silently skipped calibration is how the fake stops being calibrated.

**Span the configurations by REFUSAL.** Have the capture script raise when the fixture covers only
one seed mode / one calling convention / one branch of the thing that forks. A fixture of only
one shape leaves the other uncalibrated forever, and nothing downstream can tell.

## MUTATE THE SOURCE, NOT A FIXTURE — and expect the first run to find the arm you did not write

Every arm must be demonstrated failing, and the cheap way to demonstrate a whole suite at once is
to break a rule **in the production source**, reload the module, and require that at least one arm
notices. A poison built inside the test file tests the test file.

The value is not the mutations that fire. It is the one that does not. Measured, first run of such
a harness: forcing a mode constant to a fixed value — the rule that decides which allocation a
factory body's object *is* — **broke no arm at all**, because every arm exercising that rule ran in
the mode where the constant already had that value, so the mutation was invisible. Seventeen arms,
and the rule whose absence had cost an earlier round a full investigation was untested. One arm was
added for it.

Report it as `N of M mutations made at least one arm fail`, and treat a shortfall as a missing arm
rather than a mutation to delete.

## AN ARTIFACT OUTSIDE THE STABILITY HARNESS'S FILE-TYPE FILTER IS OUTSIDE THE HARNESS

A stability harness that regenerates producers and byte-compares their output is usually scoped by
a filename pattern — here, `symbols/*.csv`. A new fixture was JSON, so **nothing compared it**, and
a stale one would have *agreed* with the fake it calibrates, because both sides replay the same
aged disassembly. A green for the wrong reason.

Two guards, because one is a single point of failure: register the producing script so the artifact
is regenerated every pass, **and** stamp the artifact with the program version and refuse when it
disagrees with the project's state record. Check the filter's scope whenever you add an artifact in
a new format — the sweep looks universal and is not.


## NO GATE COMPARES TWO ARTIFACTS THAT CLAIM THE SAME QUANTITY

Two committed artifacts in one project disagreed about one class at one program version: an
allocation census recorded its size as **28**, and the size pipeline recorded a lower bound of
**1268** for the same class. Both files were regenerated every pass, both were byte-stable, and
every gate was green — because each gate grades an artifact against **its own producer** or
against the program, and none grades one artifact against another that claims the same thing.

That is a whole class of check nobody writes. The cost of the missing one is precise: the correct
number was sitting in the tree, committed, for as long as the wrong number was, and the round that
found the wrong number found the right one in a different file five minutes later.

**Enumerate the quantities more than one artifact claims, and write one join per quantity.** Sizes,
offsets, ownership, addresses. The join is usually ten lines and it fires on data you already have,
which makes it the cheapest kind of gate to demonstrate failing — it fails on the committed tree
the day you write it. This is the same shape as a check that compares rows *sharing a name* within
one artifact, one level up: the defect always lives in the gap between two checks that are each
correct about their own question.


## A CENSUS MUST BE TAKEN OVER THE SET THE REPAIR SCANS, NOT THE SET THE DEFECT SURFACED IN

A round found a producer crediting one class with another's construction extent, censused the
damage by joining every committed artifact against the bodies with the offending shape, and found
**one** row. The repair — a screen inside the producer — was approved against that number, with a
literal naming the one body it was allowed to refuse and a join that raises both ways.

On its first live run the screen refused **two**, and the join refused the run.

Both numbers are correct and they count different things. The artifact join counts rows that
*reached an artifact*; the screen acts on **candidates**, and only a candidate that wins its
producer's `max` ever becomes a row. The census answered a real question precisely — it was just
not the question that prices a screen.

**Before approving a repair against a number, name the exact set the repaired code will iterate**,
and take the census over that. The two sets coincide often enough that the difference is invisible
until a both-ways join makes it visible, which is the argument for writing the join at the same
time as the literal rather than after the first clean run.

## WHERE A NEW FILTER SITS IN AN EXISTING CHAIN DECIDES WHETHER IT IS A REPAIR OR A RULE CHANGE

The same screen was first placed at the front of its producer's candidate filter, before an
existing narrowing. It then claimed four bodies instead of two, and two of those had been feeding
a *counter* — the number of candidates the old narrowing refused — that a completely different
rule downstream reads as a soundness signal. The repair silently changed an input to a rule it had
nothing to do with.

Moved behind the existing narrowing, it refuses two, every other counter in the producer is
byte-identical, and it can only ever remove a body that would otherwise have been **accepted**.
Same rule, same bodies, entirely different blast radius.

**When inserting a filter into a pipeline, ask what each existing stage COUNTS, not only what it
passes.** A stage that merely drops things can be reordered freely; a stage whose reject count is
read by something else cannot.

## A POISON THAT DOUBLES AS THE DIFFERENTIAL BASELINE CANNOT DEMONSTRATE THE CHECK IT DISABLES

A producer change needs two different things from a switch: an arm that reproduces the OLD
behaviour byte-for-byte (the two-step diff's baseline, which must not raise), and a poison showing
the new check can fire. One switch tried to be both. Turning the screen off also turned off the
join that validates the screen's fired population, so the join's *missing-entry* direction had
never been seen to fire — an unfireable arm hiding inside a demonstrated one.

The fix is a second switch that disables the mechanism and **keeps** the check, which then raises.
Two arms, because one of them has a job that forbids raising.

## REGENERATION IS NOT COMPARISON

A stability harness reported `all 149 committed artifacts byte-identical` in the same pass that
changed a 150th. The artifact sweep was scoped by a filename pattern (`*.csv`); the changed file
was JSON. The project had already found that hole once and patched it by registering the file's
producer so every pass **regenerates** it — which is what kept the file current, and is not the
same as checking it.

Two distinct properties, and a harness usually only advertises one: *is this artifact current*
(regeneration) and *did this artifact change* (comparison). The honest headline is `149 of the 150
committed artifacts`, because a count without its denominator cannot say which of the two it
means.

## TWO CONSUMERS OF ONE ARTIFACT ROW CAN DISAGREE ABOUT IT, EACH INTERNALLY CONSISTENT

The known version of this trap is *"no check compares two artifacts that claim the same quantity"*.
One level in is worse, because it leaves no two files to compare: **one artifact row, spent by one
consumer and rejected by another.**

Measured. A base class's size sits in a size census at `72` under a confidence label the layout
channel's allowlist deliberately excludes. The completion tool reads that same `72` as the lower
bound of the very class's own window — every coverage percentage it reports for that class rests on
it — while the layout library refuses the class outright because the size is not in the file it
trusts. Both are right by their own rule. Nothing in the repository can see the disagreement,
because a consistency check compares *files*, and here there is only one file.

The check that would catch it is not a diff. It is a join over **consumers**: for each artifact
column that more than one tool reads, does every reader admit the same rows? A reader that filters
by a `confidence` column while another reader ignores that column is the shape to look for, and the
grep is for the column name, not for the value.

## A CONFIDENCE LABEL NAMES THE RULE THAT EMITTED A ROW, NOT THE STRENGTH OF WHAT STANDS BEHIND IT

The row above is labelled by the *weakest* rule that could have produced it, and an allowlist keyed
on that label reads the label as a grade. Its own note already recorded that an independent floor
met the exact upper bound — two structurally independent legs closing to a point, which is what the
admitted grade means — and the label still said otherwise, because labels are assigned where a row
is written and evidence accumulates afterwards.

Two consequences. **Read the witness columns before believing a confidence column** — the strength
is in the witnesses, the label is in the emitter. And when a gate refuses on a label, the fix may be
at the emitter rather than at the gate; check which change has the smaller blast radius first,
because re-labelling at source silently re-qualifies the row for *every* other rule keyed on that
column, including the ones that mutate the program.

## A TRIPWIRE THAT RESTATES THE RULE IT WATCHES CANNOT FIRE WHEN THE RULE CHANGES

A guard written to notice "the day this policy admits X" must ask the policy, never a copy of
it. Measured: an applier kept a layout in its own literal because a library function refused two
classes, and carried a guard that would fire "the day a size row lands" so the record would move.
The guard re-implemented the refusal by hand. The change that actually came was to the RULE -- a
third size file admitted, a new base tier -- not to a size row, and the hand copy, evaluated on
the post-change artifacts, still read "refused" for both classes while the real function admitted
both. The one event the guard existed for was the one event it structurally could not see,
because the copy is exactly the thing a policy change leaves untouched. Call the function.

## A RAISE ARM WRITTEN FOR A RULE CHANGE ALSO RAISES UNDER THE OLD RULE -- FOR THE WRONG REASON

When a rule is WIDENED, its old version refuses the new cases outright, so every new "must still
refuse this narrower thing" arm raises against the old code too. Measured on nine new arms: with
the library reverted, five of the six raise arms passed on an unrelated refusal, and the positive
arms were the only ones that failed. Demonstrating an arm against the pre-change source is what
exposes this; requiring each arm's own message fragment is what fixes it. A refusal is a claim
about WHY, and an arm that accepts any exception tests only that something went wrong.

## A CALIBRATION THAT GRADES A PROPERTY THE RULE NEVER CLAIMS PASSES BY COINCIDENCE

A join typed a cell only from a COMPLETE group of registered components, but its calibration
graded the implied type of PARTIAL groups as well. One partial known answer matched the default
by chance and served for months as the rule's only negative control; a second partial group with
the same shape and the opposite answer failed the calibration the moment another round decided
it. The rule was fine and the calibration was wrong: grade exactly what the rule claims. And
check what the poison actually fires on -- this one fired only on the coincidental pair, so fixing
the calibration made the poison unfireable, and it had to be rebuilt on the cases the claim branch
really uses.

## A GRADER THAT KEEPS ITS OWN COPY OF A VOCABULARY GOES STALE WHEN THE VOCABULARY GROWS

Three independent graders in one project failed the same way within one audit: one hand-typed the
confidence labels that count as an exact size and misgraded every label added later; one excluded an
input only when a column was ABSENT, and a new input with the column present and empty turned every
untyped cell into a contradiction; one keyed on a field that was blank only because of a parser bug,
so fixing the parser emptied its population. Each check stayed green or failed with a message that
pointed elsewhere, because the vocabulary it compared against was its own. Derive the vocabulary from
the thing that owns it (the deciders' constants, the mangling code, the cell's width), and add an arm
that fails when a value exists upstream that the grader does not classify. When a vacuity check fires,
its message must name BOTH sides of the join -- one that lists only the reference set sends the reader
to "the reference set shrank" when the other side went to zero.

## A GUARD THAT ENUMERATES THE ROUNDS IT PROTECTS PROTECTS NO ROUND ADDED AFTER IT

A multi-round applier carried its rollback test as `if MODE == "rollbacktest" and TOKEN in ("421",
"426"): raise`, with a second arm for the rounds that have no step 1. A new round's token matched
neither, so the "rollback test" would have run the cascade, passed the post-cascade re-assert and
written three ledgers -- a real apply, performed by the mode whose only purpose is to prove nothing is
written, and every count would have closed afterwards. It was found by reading the mode arms before
running them; no gate could have seen it, because the outcome is indistinguishable from a correct
apply. The same file had the opposite defect in a poison: `plan_classes[0] = poisoned` on an empty
step-2 plan is an `IndexError` far from the guard it poisons, and a traceback reads as a broken
harness rather than as the measured fact "this guard has no population in this round". Two rules.
Key a guard on the SHAPE of the round the code can observe (`step1 and not plan_classes`), or make an
unknown token a refusal -- never a silent fall-through into the mutating path. And a poison whose
population is empty must `raise` with that sentence, in the words a round record can quote; the
neighbouring poison in the same file already did, which is how such a gap survives: the pattern was
present and not applied. (Origin: re-metal-fatigue §428.)

## A gate's MEMORY must be held to the gate's own rule, and a GENERATED file is stale the round after it is regenerated

Two shapes of the same defect, both measured with every gate green. **First:** a completion gate
refused to grade a denominator that was measured in the previous ledger row and is NOT MEASURED now
(its artifact left stale by a version bump) -- and the *recorder* that writes that ledger had no such
rule, so it wrote a row with the cell blank, and the next gate run graded against that row and passed.
The read side and the write side of one append-only record had different rules; the hole was
permanent until read by eye. The repair is one function used by both modes, and the strongest arm is
the real situation replayed against a copy of the artifacts: the recorder refuses, exit 1, nothing
written. Rule: whatever a gate refuses to READ, its recorder must refuse to WRITE; a check that grades
against its own history is only as good as what the history was allowed to contain. **Second:** two
generated C headers were found 13 and ~95 program versions stale and regenerated; the check built the
next round found one stale AGAIN, one round later, by a single typed cell. Regeneration repairs the
instance; the join repairs the pattern. The join that works is the one already used for excused
artifacts: give the generator an output-directory option (~10 lines each), run it into scratch,
byte-compare, and key the population on a directory LISTING joined both ways -- every file is
regenerated or excused with a reason, every row names a file that exists, an empty listing refuses,
and a non-CSV difference is reported by its first differing line so a stale header names the member
that moved. Ask of every committed derived file *"what re-derives this and compares?"*; if the answer
is "someone runs the generator", it is already stale. (Origin: re-metal-fatigue §435.)

## The file a tool is forbidden to touch is the file it never looks at — ratchet every append-only record against its committed copy

A project's lessons file (append-only, never generated, ~16,000 lines) was replaced by one round's
21-line block -- a whole-file write where an append was meant -- and the next three rounds appended
to the stub. Every gate stayed green: no gate read the file, and the bookkeeping tool's own contract
("this file is byte-identical across an apply") was exactly why it never inspected it. The index tool
printed the denominator on every query -- "0 of 3 blocks" -- and it was read as a zero, not as a 3.
Two rules. **Every append-only record needs a ratchet against its own committed copy (HEAD through
git), placed in the tool every round already runs, refusing when the count falls and refusing when
HEAD cannot be read.** And **a denominator printed beside a zero is a measurement**: a count far
below what you know the file holds is the finding, however healthy the zero beside it looks. The
strongest arm is the history itself (the truncating commit against its parent: 1 heading vs 279),
not a constructed poison. (Origin: re-metal-fatigue §439.)

**A gate's verdict is its OWN exit status -- `gate | tail; echo $?` prints `tail`'s.** Measured: a
completeness gate exited 2 (a refusal) at the start of a session and the check printed `EXIT 0`, because the
status read was the pipe's last stage; the red gate stood until an agent ran the tool bare, hours later.
Run a gate unpiped, or redirect it to a file and read `$?` before any other command -- and treat a gate whose
status you did not read directly as NOT RUN. (Origin: re-metal-fatigue §479.)

**A selftest whose ground truth is the LIVE program goes red the moment its own apply succeeds.** Measured: three
census tools of one wave each carried arms like "this address is a planned string" or "12 datums will be absorbed",
read from the current export of the program; the apply is precisely what makes those false, so after a clean apply
4, 13 and 2 arms failed -- and the previous round had hit the same shape in one tool and fixed only that tool. Pin a
ground-truth arm to a COMMITTED pre-apply fixture (the facts it needs, captured once), refuse when the fixture is
absent rather than pass, and run the selftest against the post-apply state during the rolled-back rehearsal, where
the failure is free. "Passes before and after its own apply" is a run, not a sentence. Related: **two checks that
must agree about one ledger need one rule** -- two verifier fixes, each right for its own lane (accept a row a later
container absorbs; accept only MISSING rows), contradicted each other on the same absorbed value after the apply;
the shared predicate now lives in one imported module. (Origin: re-metal-fatigue §489.)
