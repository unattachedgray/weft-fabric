# Harvesting traps

*Reference for the `ghidra-iterative-re` skill. Only `SKILL.md` is loaded when the
skill is invoked; this file is read on demand when its trigger fires. New lessons of
this kind belong here, not in `SKILL.md`.*

**Read this when:** you are about to write or re-run a sweep, a probe, or anything that
reads evidence back out of the program — and before you believe a census, a zero, or a
reach estimate it produced.

**In this file:**

- Self-harvest and circular evidence
- Derivations, and repairing them at the source
- The instrument you read with
- Censuses, zeros and skip counters
- Calibrating and pricing a witness
- Undefined code and the byte-pattern engine
- Identity, joins and populations

### Self-harvest and circular evidence

- **The decompiler's signature is not necessarily the database's.** With no committed
  signature the decompiler applies local heuristics, so its display can differ from the
  Listing and *two call sites of the same function can show different signatures*.
  Reading a signature from decompiler output is not evidence it is in the database.
  `Commit Params/Return` commits it.
- **Harvesters are not idempotent across an apply.** The same harvester can legitimately
  yield different evidence afterward — a matcher for `T Func(...)` stops matching once an
  apply rewrites it. So: **stamp every evidence row with the program version it came
  from**, treat earlier evidence as **append-only**, and teach post-apply harvesters to
  accept the post-apply shape. Regenerating after an apply can silently drop whole
  witness categories while looking like a clean re-run.

- **The sharper version of that trap: the second run harvests *your own* output.** Stale
  evidence is the mild failure. The severe one is a harvester that re-reads names *this
  agent applied* and files them as findings — because those names then feed whatever
  decides the next apply, closing the loop on itself.

  It hides well for a structural reason: **a harvester written before any apply exists is
  correct when written, and only becomes circular the first time it is re-run after one.**
  Nothing changes in the harvester, no test fails, and the output looks richer than before.
  Measured here: re-running a slot-symbol sweep after a naming apply would have folded 8
  agent-applied names back into the very file feeding the calibration gate and the naming
  rule — i.e. into the inputs deciding what to name next.

  So the `SourceType.AI` exclusion is not a property you add once to "the harvesters" — it
  is a property every harvester needs *before its second run*. Audit them at the moment the
  round's first apply lands, not when they are written. Treat an agent-sourced name as
  **identical to no name at all**: absent from evidence, and still an open candidate. Then
  assert it: after any re-harvest, check that every address in your applied-names ledger
  comes back unnamed in the fresh evidence, and fail if one does not.

  **The oldest harvester is the most dangerous one**, and it is worth naming that explicitly
  because it inverts the intuition that old code is safe. The sweep that ran first, before
  any apply existed, is the one whose author had no reason to write the filter — so it is
  both the most trusted artifact in the project and the only one with no protection. Measured
  on a second occasion here, years of rounds later: the original vtable sweep was regenerated
  and **578 of 578** changed function names joined, *by address*, to the agent's own applied-
  names ledger — 0 from any other source. The committed artifact was found to have already
  captured 8 such names from an earlier round. **Join by address, never by name**, or the
  audit itself inherits the collision problem below.
- **A producer whose CLASSIFICATION INPUT is derived from its own output is self-harvesting,
  there is no `SourceType` tier to filter on, and you fix it at the DERIVATION rather than by
  loosening the gate.** The self-harvest rule above is about
  *symbols*; this is the same failure on the **artifact** axis, where the only defence is
  arithmetic. Shape: sweep S writes artifact A; derivation D folds A into artifact B; S reads
  B to decide what is new. Measured: a destructor-chain witness classified its claims against
  a hierarchy file built from its own edges, and on the second run its two contradictions had
  become agreements *with itself* — agreement counters up by exactly the folded edges
  (100/209 → 101/210), contradictions **2 → 0**, and every gate green for the wrong reason.
  Three things do it, and the third is the one that actually catches it:
  - **Design the artifact so the pre-fold view is RECONSTRUCTIBLE.** Record, per row, what the
    value used to be (`superseded_base`) and which entities the fold created. A fold you
    cannot undo on paper is one you cannot audit.
  - **Subtract your own previous output at load, then classify — and PRINT that you did it.**
    A silent subtraction is as unauditable as a silent fold.
  - **The vacuity guard is what catches this, not any value check.** Nothing here was
    "wrong": no count mismatched, no artifact drifted. The only thing that fired was the
    selftest arm asserting there was still a contradiction available to poison with. A
    self-harvesting producer fails by having its findings quietly go to zero while every
    other number *improves*, so a census selftest without a vacuity arm cannot see it.
- **N-OF-N AGREEMENT IS WORTH NOTHING WHEN ONE SIDE WAS APPLIED FROM THE OTHER — AND IT IS THE
  MOST PERSUASIVE-LOOKING NUMBER YOU WILL PRODUCE.** Measured: a probe found **43 of 43** names
  in a property registrar matching the field names on the recovered structs exactly. Read as an
  independent witness confirming the layouts, that is a striking corroboration. It is
  tautological: the applier that built those structs *reads that registry*. This is the
  self-harvest rule on the ARTIFACT axis, where no `SourceType` tier exists to filter on, so the
  only defence is provenance and arithmetic — before recording any agreement as evidence, ask
  **"would this cell hold this value if we had applied nothing?"** and name the producer on each
  side. A perfect score is the shape to distrust first.
- **"NO EVIDENCE SOURCE EXISTS FOR THIS" IS A RESULT, AND BELONGS IN THE RECORD AS ONE.** A
  layout round can recover offsets and widths for thousands of cells and still have no source
  anywhere that could NAME them. Measured: of every committed artifact carrying both an offset and
  a name, exactly one had a class column intersecting the recovered population at all — reaching
  16 of 198 classes, whose names were already applied. So 182 classes and ~3750 fields have no
  naming source in the project. Left as a task on an open list, "name the fields" reads as
  available work forever and gets re-derived every few rounds; recorded as a measurement, with the
  sources checked and what would change the answer, it stops costing anything.
### Derivations, and repairing them at the source

- **Two identical branches of an `if`/`else` are a silent UNDER-REPORT, not dead code.** Where
  you wrote a branch to express a distinction and both arms do the same thing, the distinction
  is simply unmeasured — and the output still looks like a working measurement with a small
  answer. Measured: a probe meant to treat "the class's own store survived" and "it was
  elided" differently emitted the same pairs in both cases, so an entire claim category went
  untested and single-element chains produced nothing at all. Repairing it moved that arm from
  unmeasured to 209 agreements and 1 contradiction. Diff the arms of any `if`/`else` you wrote
  for a reason.
- **A calibration gate on a witness that may legitimately STRENGTHEN must be a FLOOR, not an
  equality.** The failure worth catching is the witness going *quiet*; an equality additionally
  fails every time the program legitimately grows, which trains the reader to re-baseline it.
- **Do not MERGE the artifact you are using as an independent cross-check.** A new witness
  agreeing with an unrelated artifact 30 of 30 is worth more as a standing corroboration than
  as 29 extra rows — folding them makes the two agree by construction and destroys the
  measurement that justified the witness in the first place. Independence is a property you
  spend when you merge.
- **A pipeline that derives wrong and patches afterwards violates this rule from the
  inside, and it hides for years.** The version everyone catches is a one-off hand edit.
  The version nobody catches is a *second script* that corrects the first one's output as
  a routine pipeline step: the committed artifact is correct, every consumer is happy, and
  the derivation stays broken. Measured: a vtable sweep labelled each table by its slot-0
  function's namespace and a separate script overwrote that with honest labels afterwards
  — so a plain run of the sweep produced a file naming **29746 of 31341 rows after a
  single base class**, 95% of it wrong, and the stability harness (which runs sweeps, not
  post-steps) reported ~29700 drifting cells on every pass until someone read them. Test
  for it directly: **run each producer alone and ask whether its output is the committed
  artifact.** If a second step is required to make it honest, the artifact is not
  derivable and the fix belongs in the producer — after which the post-step should be
  retired to a no-op you assert stays a no-op.
- **Fix a wrong artifact at its DERIVATION, not by patching the rows.** When a defect in
  committed evidence is proven, the tempting round is to amend the data — it is smaller,
  and the diff is reviewable. But a patched artifact stops being re-derivable, which is the
  property that made it evidence; the producing rule stays wrong; and the next regeneration
  silently reintroduces the whole defect. Measured here: a boundary rule that mistook a
  constant-propagated virtual-call reference for a table start had forged 7 tables. Patching
  the 55 affected rows and fixing the rule cost the same effort — the rule fix also fixed
  the *next* regeneration, and turned the 7 known cases into a live calibration gate.
- **Separate program drift from the change under test, or you cannot read the diff.**
  Re-running a harvester that was written many rounds ago never reproduces its committed
  output, because the program has moved underneath it — so "regenerate and diff" conflates
  two entirely different populations of change. Run the **old** rule first and diff *that*
  against the committed artifact (pure drift, adjudicated alone), then diff the **new** rule
  against the old rule's fresh output (your change, and nothing else). Keep the old rule
  reachable behind an argument for exactly this. Here the naive one-step diff showed ~29748
  rows changed and was unreadable; the two-step version resolved it into "a post-processing
  step I had forgotten to apply", "578 rows of self-harvested names" (above), and finally
  the **55 rows** the change was actually supposed to make.
### The instrument you read with

- **A p-code harvester must state its simplification style, and calibrate across two —
  but read `buildDefaultGroups()` before choosing which two.**
  `DecompInterface.setSimplificationStyle` takes `decompile` (default), `normalize`,
  `firstpass`, `paramid`, `register`. The default style runs a rule called **`earlyremoval`
  that deletes COPY operations whose output has no descendant — including stack writes
  rendered dead by a function signature, whether or not that signature is correct.** For a
  project whose layout evidence is "which offsets does this constructor write", that would
  be a silent under-count arriving from inside the tool, possibly caused by a signature
  *you* applied.

  **An earlier revision of this document said to compare `normalize` against `decompile` to
  expose it. That is wrong, measured against a 12.1.2 install**, and it is worth stating
  loudly because the advice looks obviously right:

  ```
  coreaction.cc:5563   actdead->addRule( new RuleEarlyRemoval("deadcode") );
  ```

  and `ActionDatabase::buildDefaultGroups()` lists `"deadcode"` in the member arrays of
  **both** `decompile` and `normalize`. That comparison holds the named rule constant. The
  only shipped styles omitting `deadcode` are **`register`** (`base`, `analysis`, `subvar`)
  and **`firstpass`** (`base` alone) — so `register` is the style that actually tests
  `earlyremoval`, and `firstpass` is the control that shows what the analysis was buying.
  What `normalize` really omits is **`typerecovery`**, which is a different and often more
  interesting question: it is the group that consumes *the types you applied*.

  **Generalise past the specific fact:** `buildDefaultGroups()` is the ground truth for
  what a style runs. The javadoc's one-line descriptions ("omits type recovery and some of
  the final clean-up steps") do not say which rules move, and a round planned from them
  targets the wrong comparison — burning the round's whole budget on a comparison that was
  never capable of firing.

  Measured on one project, over the 14 array-loop candidates behind its only exact size
  witness: `decompile`, `normalize` and `register` each decided all **12** strides with
  **identical values**; `firstpass` decided 1. Zero contradictions, zero cases of a
  less-processed style deciding where the default declined. A real answer, and cheap — but
  only because the comparison was picked from the groups rather than from the prose.

- **An instruction-level harvester that accepts only IMMEDIATE operands under-counts exactly
  where the compiler HOISTS a repeated constant into a register — and the blanks look like a
  property of the data.** A string-registration parser read `MOV [reg+8], imm` and missed
  `MOV EDI, "float"` loaded once per body and stored from the register per record: 49 of 83
  type cells came back blank, every one of them `float`, every `int` captured — a pattern
  that invites a story about the API ("only ints are typed") rather than about the reader.
  Before theorising about a blank census, compare ONE body against the decompiler's view of
  it; then fix it at the derivation, keep the old arm reachable behind an argument, and run
  every consumer through the old-vs-committed / new-vs-old two-step diff (here: 0 drift, then
  exactly 4 evidence cells and 0 decided-layout rows). Track register loads with the same
  invalidation discipline as an alias tracker: any write to the register drops it, a CALL
  drops the caller-saved set, the callee-saved registers survive — which is precisely why the
  compiler parks the hoisted strings there.
- **Measure the decompiler-derived SURFACE before auditing it.** The audit above was queued
  on the premise that the project's layout witnesses were harvested from decompiler output.
  One census — *which scripts construct a `DecompInterface`* — refuted it: every write-set
  witness read raw instructions through `listing.getInstructions()`, and the entire
  decompiler-derived evidence surface was **one function**. A p-code simplification rule
  cannot perturb a witness that never asks for p-code. The premise had sat unchallenged in a
  queued round for a week, and it cost one command to check.

  **QUALIFIED, and the qualification is the more useful half: "not the decompiler" is not the
  same as "not p-code", and there are THREE levels here, not two.** Reading raw instructions
  does insulate a witness from simplification rules — and if it reads
  `getDefaultOperandRepresentation()`, it buys that insulation by throwing away the
  instruction's SEMANTICS, which is a worse trade than it looks:

  | level | what it is | carries direction? | simplification rules? |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | rendered operand text | `getDefaultOperandRepresentation()` + a regex | **no** | no |
  | **raw instruction p-code** | **`Instruction.getPcode()` — the SLEIGH spec itself** | **yes** | **no** |
  | decompiler p-code | `HighFunction` / `DecompInterface` | yes | yes |

  The middle row is the one projects skip, and it is strictly better than the first: same
  insulation, plus the processor specification's own account of what the instruction does.
  Measured: a write-set witness parsed operand 0 with a regex and recorded it as a WRITE,
  because operand 0 is the destination for `MOV`. It is a **source** for `CMP`, `TEST`, `FLD`,
  `FMUL` and every x87 memory form — so **1552 of 21249 committed `ctor_write` rows (7.3%),
  across 151 of 198 classes, were reads**. Nothing failed; the offsets were real, the sizes
  they bounded were right (a read of `this+K` proves K is inside the object exactly as a store
  does), and only the LABEL was false. `getPcode()` containing a `STORE` op answers the
  direction question authoritatively, because it *is* the processor's definition.

  Two riders, both measured on that repair:

  - **Do not hand-write the mnemonic list.** The first attempt at the fix was a
    `READ_OP0 = {CMP, TEST, PUSH, FLD, ...}` set typed from memory. Graded against the SLEIGH
    answer on the same instructions it **disagreed on 70 of 2221**. This is the skill's own
    "discover the API from the install, not from memory" rule pointed at instruction semantics,
    where it is easier to fall for because the mnemonics feel like common knowledge.
  - **A relabel moves evidence in BOTH directions — measure both before predicting the net.**
    The repair was expected to *reduce* corroboration, since some cells were corroborated by a
    write that turned out to be a read: 8 such rows were counted, and a drop was predicted.
    The actual result was a **rise, 317 → 347**, because the mislabel had been *collapsing two
    independent witness kinds under one name* and hiding corroboration at far more cells than
    it invented it at — **570 cells gained** a distinct kind against **41** that lost one. The
    prediction was wrong because only the loss direction had been counted, which is exactly the
    half-measurement this document demands a counter for when a rule changes.

- **Do NOT test whether a witness depends on types you applied by withholding an opcode
  downstream of type recovery.** Same project, same round: the exact-size witness read
  multiplier constants from `INT_MULT` inputs and `PTRADD` element sizes, and `PTRADD`'s
  constant is the size of a pointed-to type — i.e. of a struct the project itself applied.
  Withholding `PTRADD` lost **9 of 12** strides, which reads as "9 exact sizes rest on our
  own applied types". **False.** `RulePtrArith` (group `typerecovery`) *consumes* the
  `INT_MULT` it folds into the `PTRADD`, so withholding the `PTRADD` removes the only
  surviving copy of a constant that was never type-derived; at `normalize`, with
  `typerecovery` off, the identical constants return as `INT_MULT` and all 12 decide. Turn
  the **type recovery** off and re-measure. An opcode-withholding test is invalid wherever
  the analysis consumes the alternative form — and note which way it failed: it
  *manufactured* a serious finding rather than hiding one.
- **Your own markup perturbs similarity witnesses.** Ghidra's BSim tutorial warns that
  applying debug information changes BSim signatures and can degrade matching — so a
  correlation run *after* an apply round is not measuring the same thing as one before it.
  Capture similarity evidence early, or record which program version it came from.
### Censuses, zeros and skip counters

- **Distinguish measured-zero from structural-zero.** "I looked and found nothing" and
  "there was nothing to look at" are different findings. Emit counters that separate them.
  **Print the zeros**: a census listing only the kinds that fired cannot be told apart
  from one where a kind is dead, so enumerate every expected witness kind with its count
  including `0`, and say which zeros are known limitations of the scanner.
- **An artifact derived from an EXTERNAL input must name that input beside it, and a
  regeneration must be checked against the named input — diff MAGNITUDE is the tell.** A
  comparison against an external oracle was regenerated with the wrong one of two archived
  oracle outputs; the mistake announced itself as a diff in which the ORACLE-side columns
  moved — something the change under test structurally could not do — and at ~20× the
  expected size. Before adjudicating any regeneration diff, ask which columns the change
  could possibly touch; a diff outside that set is an input-identity failure, not a
  finding.
- **A MAXIMAL PRINTABLE RUN IS NOT A STRING — sweep its SUFFIXES, or a string whose
  neighbour ends in a printable byte is invisible.** A C string's END is observable (the
  NUL is what the program itself uses); its START is not — a string simply begins wherever
  the previous datum stopped. So a string sweep built on `[\x20-\x7e]{n,}` silently prefixes
  every name whose preceding constant happens to end printable, and no token split on
  non-alphanumerics recovers it. Measured on one binary: two class names went unrecovered
  for eleven rounds and were written up as *"no string anywhere in the install hashes to
  either"* — a **measured zero that was a defect in the reader**, the same family as the
  immediate-operand under-count above. The donors were ordinary float constants:
  `255.0f` = `00 00 7f 43` ends in `'C'`, `1024.0f` = `00 00 80 44` ends in `'D'`, so
  `CRendScaledFont` and `CSimpleAnimation` were swept as `CCRendScaledFont` and
  `DCSimpleAnimation` — one byte long, hashing to nothing, in four separate DLLs. Yield each
  run's bounded suffixes as well (a 4-byte datum contributes at most 3 printable bytes
  before the run breaks, so a skip bound of 4 covers it). Three follow-ups, all cheap:
  - **The same widening usually feeds a MEASURED ZERO somewhere else, so measure it before
    landing it.** Here the dictionary also carried a "of 588 unresolved ids, exactly one is
    the hash of any string in the install" claim, and a single accidental collision would
    have reopened it. A standalone probe over 6,034,721 runs, run before the edit: the
    skip-0 arm reproduced the old result exactly and the skip-1..4 arm added **zero** ids —
    2.49M → 4.67M distinct strings for the identical zero, i.e. the claim got *stronger*.
    Had the probe come back non-zero, the honest outcome was a recorded cost, not a
    quietly-unwidened sweep.
  - **Require the NUL when you match.** Matching a name as a bare substring is exactly what
    the trap defeats; `name + b"\x00"` is the boundary the distortion cannot fake.
  - **Retract the old claim IN PLACE, and retire the lead it spawned.** The wrong zero had
    grown a follow-up ("their registrars are the best lead, look in this code blob") that
    was never needed — the answer was in a different binary the whole time. A stale lead
    reads as an opportunity forever; strike it where a reader will meet it.
- **A GUARD THAT COMPARES ADDRESSES WHERE IT MEANS VALUES discards whole bodies the moment
  the compiler duplicates a tail.** The conservative rule "the last relevant write in this
  function must be one my tracker attributed, or nothing here is trustworthy" is correct.
  Expressing it as *"last-tracked-write **location** == last-write-of-any-kind
  **location**"* is not. Measured: a compiler duplicated a factory's epilogue across a branch
  instead of joining it, emitting two identical writes of the same value; the register-restore
  instruction between them legitimately kills the tracker, so the second write is seen but
  unattributed — two locations, one value, and the guard threw the entire function away.
  Six exact class sizes were absent from every artifact for months, reported honestly as
  `skipped: no_tracked_construction=6`. The sibling class whose branches merged *before* the
  write had been decided exactly, and sat in the same file.

  Compare the VALUE: every relevant write from the last attributed one onward must carry the
  same value. Three things make that a repair rather than a loosening, and all three are
  cheap:
  - **Assert the direction.** State whether the new rule is strictly weaker or strictly
    stronger and make the probe *count the other direction and raise*. Here a
    `REGRESSIONS (old True → new False)` counter asserted **0**, with an example address in
    the exception. "12 rows changed" alone cannot tell a repair from a hole.
  - **Measure reach over the FIRE POPULATION, not the cases in hand.** The guard had five
    consumers, one of them a mutating applier that the read-only stability harness is blind
    to by construction, so proving the six known cases proved nothing about the rest. Both
    rules were run over every function under every seeding the consumers use — 11248
    body/seeding pairs — and exactly 12 moved.
  - **Point the probe at the PRODUCTION implementation once the rule lands.** Written with
    two local copies of the rule it is a one-off; extracting the rule into the library and
    having the probe call it for both settings turns the same hand-built arms into a standing
    regression test on the shipped code.
- **A SKIP COUNTER is a to-do list, not a footnote — and an absent ROW hides better than a
  blank CELL.** This document already says to print the zeros and to suspect the reader
  before theorising about a blank census. The sharper failure is one rung up: a sweep that
  honestly prints `skipped: no_tracked_construction=6` beside 196 successes, and a decider
  that honestly reports those 6 as "no upper bound". Nothing is hidden and nothing is
  wrong — yet the six classes are absent from the artifact *entirely*, so no census of it
  can see them, and the project's narrative silently became "nothing allocates these"
  (a story about the DATA) when the truth was one line of reader limitation. Measured: all
  six were allocated by an ordinary factory whose `PUSH 0x230` sat twelve bytes before the
  call, and reading ONE of those factories by hand produced six exact class sizes that a
  purpose-built witness round had failed to reach. **Treat every non-zero skip counter as
  a queued item with an owner, and read one skipped case by hand before believing any
  conclusion drawn over the survivors.** A blank cell at least appears in the census; a
  dropped row does not appear anywhere.
- **A CALL TO A BASE CONSTRUCTOR IS NOT AN ALLOCATION OF THE BASE — AND THE MISLABEL PRINTS A
  PLAUSIBLE, PRECISE, WRONG SIZE.** Asking *"is class X ever allocated on its own?"* as *"is there
  an allocation whose object is handed to X's constructor?"* is the natural phrasing and it is
  wrong under single inheritance: a descendant's factory allocates the DESCENDANT and calls the
  base constructor on the same pointer. Measured, on a class bounded [452, 496]: the probe
  answered **2 direct allocations, of 676 and 496 bytes** — which are exactly the two descendants'
  sizes — and printed *"DIRECT ALLOCATIONS of AIUnit -> 676 bytes"*, a confident wrong size for
  the very class the round existed to size. **Classify each allocation against the known
  descendant sizes before attributing it to the base.** Note the direction of the failure: it
  MANUFACTURES a finding rather than hiding one, which is the direction that gets believed.
- **A CLASS'S VTABLE IS NOT ITS POPULATION — IT IS ONLY THE VIRTUAL HALF.** A per-class witness
  built from vtable slot targets silently omits the constructor and every non-virtual member,
  which are compiled as the class and are exactly as good a witness. Measured: a size probe
  scanned 4 slot targets, found nothing above offset 88, and was one step from recording a
  measured zero over a population that **excluded the constructor which had produced the class's
  existing lower bound of 452**. Widening to slots + constructor + namespace members + bodies
  taking a `Class *` this-parameter moved the highest observed access from **88 to 452** — and
  that jump is the check that the widening reached the right code rather than merely more of it.
  Before believing any per-class census, ask whether its population is the CLASS or just its
  vtable.
- **MEASURE A NEGATIVE FROM BOTH DIRECTIONS, THEN RETIRE THE LEAD EXPLICITLY.** "This class's own
  bodies never reach past K" is half an answer; the other half is whether its DESCENDANTS write
  below their own start, which would move the boundary the other way. Both came back zero, which
  turned an earlier round's prose claim — *"nothing observes those 44 bytes"* — into a
  measurement. Then **say the lead is exhausted, name the routes that were run, and name the
  evidence that would still settle it** (here a runtime observation at the descendant's factory,
  recorded at its own provenance tier since it is a fact about one execution). A stale "unknown"
  reads as an opportunity forever, and the next round will otherwise re-derive the same negative.
- **PRICING THE NEXT ROUND IS A REVIEW OF THE LAST ONE — POINT THE PRICING PROBE AT LAST
  ROUND'S ARTIFACT WITH A DIFFERENT QUESTION, BECAUSE IT CATCHES WHAT THE GATES STRUCTURALLY
  CANNOT.** This document already says to price a queued round against the program
  because a plan's premises decay. The other half is that the pricing probe is the first thing to
  look at last round's ARTIFACT with a different question, which makes it the cheapest review you
  will ever get. Measured: a layout round shipped with its tiling guard passing on every class,
  its re-derivation calibration at 198/198 and an outside-route calibration at 500/500 — all
  green, all correct, and all blind. The next round's apply census then printed a stratum named
  *"fields start at 0"* whose members had a recorded base, and **a class with a base cannot own
  byte 0; that is its base's vptr.** The guards were checking internal consistency; only the
  census asked what the rows MEANT. Two things generalise:
  - **A FALLBACK THAT DEGRADES SILENTLY TO ZERO WILL BE READ AS A MEASUREMENT.** The boundary
    computation fell back to "how far did our own walk of the base reach", which is legitimately 0
    for a base outside the walked population — so one value meant both *"this class genuinely
    starts at 0"* and *"we have no idea where its base ends"*. 33 of 99 classes, **79% of the
    field rows**, took the second path while being reported as the first. Make a fallback chain
    record WHICH RUNG it landed on, as a value in the row: here `base_sizeof` /
    `base_ctor_write_max` / `base_observed_extent` / `base_unmeasured`. Same family as
    "distinguish measured-zero from structural-zero", one level down — inside a derivation rather
    than in a census.
  - **WHEN THE ROWS ARE RIGHT AND THE LABEL IS WRONG, ADD THE LABEL; DO NOT DELETE THE ROWS.**
    Excluding the affected classes or blanking their fields would have discarded 2839 correct
    observations — every cell was a real access to a real byte of the object. What was false was
    the claim that they were the class's OWN storage. A `scope` column repaired it, and the
    reclassified rows turned out to be the MOST useful for the apply that follows, because they
    already cover `[0, sizeof)`.
- **A SUMMARY LINE THAT AVERAGES TWO POPULATIONS IS WRONG EVEN WHEN EVERY ROW IN IT IS RIGHT.**
  The same round reported "27603 of 50468 own bytes = 54.7%", arithmetic over a mixture of
  own-storage and whole-object rows. Split, the two real figures are **35.8%** and **58.9%** —
  and the headline sat between them, resembling both and describing neither. Before reporting a
  ratio, ask whether its denominator means ONE thing; this is the reporting analogue of the
  vacuity guard, and it fails in the direction that looks most like success.
- **AND THE SKIP COUNTER CAN BE A FINDING WEARING A FAILURE'S CLOTHES — SPLIT THE PREDICATE
  BEFORE BELIEVING THE COUNT.** The rule above says to treat a non-zero skip counter as a queued
  item. The sharper case is where the counter is not a limitation at all. Measured: a layout
  producer refused 99 classes on `sizeof(base) >= sizeof(class)`, sound reasoning because a base
  at least as large as its derived class contradicts containment. Every one of the 99 was
  **equality, and none was strictly larger** — the ordinary behaviour-only subclass, which
  overrides virtuals and adds no data members. Printed as "99 skipped" that reads as the tool
  failing; the truth was *99 classes proven to add no fields*, established by two independently
  derived sizes (each class's own allocation, and the base's own artifact). One `>=` had
  collapsed a finding and a contradiction into a single bucket, and the finding was the larger
  half. Whenever a guard's condition is a comparison, ask what each side of the boundary means
  separately — this is the "absent row hides better than a blank cell" failure moved one level
  up, into the PREDICATE rather than the reader, where no census of the output can see it.
- **A census read from decompiled C must also read the spelling its own apply will produce.** A
  census that licenses typing a vtable matched the untyped call render
  `(**(code **)(*(int *)g + 0x78))(...)`. The apply it licensed replaced that spelling with
  `(*g->vftable->slot_30)(g, ...)` (typed, `this` now rendered) and `(*(code *)g->vftable->slot_30)(...)`
  (held). Re-derived after the apply, it found **0 of 303** call sites. Worse, one slot had been held
  because an exe-side witness contradicted the DLL side, and with that witness's spelling gone the
  re-derivation would have TYPED it. Taught all three spellings, the post-apply census was *richer*
  than the pre-apply one: 16 call sites invisible before the apply surfaced (the 303 had been a
  floor), the new prototypes had resolved every arity mismatch, and one slot declared `void`
  turned out to have its result consumed. **If a census is meant to be re-checked after the
  mutation it licenses, list the spellings the mutation creates before writing the matcher**, and
  make the re-check run on the post-apply output, not just the pre-apply one. Two narrower traps
  in the same instrument, both silent: a "result consumed?" test that looked one character before
  the call (a `(int *)` cast hid 24 of 25 consuming sites), and a call pattern that required the
  argument list on the same line (the decompiler splits long calls; 257 of 303 found).
- **Some witnesses cannot be re-taught at all, because the apply does not change their SPELLING — it
  changes who is speaking. Move those to the listing BEFORE the apply.** Same instrument, one round
  later. Its second witness for "this slot returns a float" was the decompiler's `(float10)` cast at
  the call sites. That cast is what the decompiler writes for an *untyped* call leaving a value in
  ST0; declare the slot `float` and it disappears, and the render that remains
  (`fVar2 = (*g->vftable->GetTerrainHeight)(...)`) merely restates the type the round itself applied.
  Teaching the matcher the new spelling would not have helped: post-apply **the witness is our own
  declaration read back**, which is the self-harvest trap wearing the clothes of a text pattern. The
  fix was to ask the same question of the instructions, where no type can reach it — from the CALL,
  does the caller use ST0 before pushing anything of its own? Ground truth both ways on that binary:
  ST0 used or discarded after every attributed call on all four called x87 slots, and on **0 of the
  36 called non-x87 slots** — a negative control the C-level witness could not have produced at all.
  **Before an apply, sort each witness into "still independent afterwards" and "about to be quoting
  me"; the second kind must move to a lower level — disassembly, relocations, the file — or retire.**
- **A PARSER DEFECT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A CRASH. IT LOOKS LIKE A CENSUS.** A census keyed on rendered
  prototypes read each function's block out of a concatenated corpus stream. Run one kept the
  stream's own delimiter line (`0x00484d20 SetUnitParams`), so every "return type" parsed as a
  function name: **0 decidable rows, 222 contradictions**. Run two stripped comment LINES but not
  comment BLOCKS, and a multi-line provenance comment left its tail in the prototype, so every return
  parsed as the last word before `*/`: **0 decidable, 563 contradictions**. Both runs printed a
  well-formed, internally consistent, confidently formatted census; nothing in either output looked
  like a bug. What caught it was the instrument's CALIBRATION — *where the decompiler has an opinion,
  does it match the binary's own declaration?* — reading **0.0%**, which is not a plausible statement
  about a working decompiler. **Give a census one number whose healthy value you know independently
  of the census, and make an implausible value a REFUSAL rather than a headline.** Both defects are
  now poisons: each one, reintroduced, drives that number to zero and the run refuses.
### Calibrating and pricing a witness

- **A RANKING TELLS YOU WHERE TO LOOK AND NEVER WHAT YOU WILL FIND — SO A READ-IT-BY-HAND ROUND
  CANNOT BE PRICED BEFORE SOME OF IT HAS BEEN READ.** A pricing probe over a ranked list sees only
  the columns it computed — address, size, call count — and those columns are blind to the one thing
  that decides the round's cost: whether the population has a SHAPE. Measured: a fan-in ranking of
  unnamed functions was priced as *"25–50 bodies, no mechanical rule, a hand-read round"*, which was
  an honest reading of what the ranking showed. Nine bodies later the head was **dominated by
  constructors and destructors**, which carry the most exact class evidence in the binary — the
  address the code writes into `[this+0]` **is** the class, an instruction operand rather than an
  inference. The rule was there the whole time; the ranking could not display it.

  Two consequences worth acting on:
  - **Read a handful before quoting a price.** Five to ten bodies is cheap next to scoping a round
    around "no mechanical rule" and then discovering one — or worse, budgeting for a mechanical rule
    that is not there.
  - **Then write the producer that re-derives what the reading found**, so the population is
    checkable rather than a claim about what somebody noticed. The reading supplies the hypothesis;
    the producer supplies the census. Neither substitutes for the other.

  The same asymmetry runs the other way: a ranking that looks *promising* can price a route that
  does not exist. Pricing is a claim about a population, and a claim about a population needs a
  sample.

- **CALIBRATE A NEW LAYOUT WITNESS ON THE BASE SUBOBJECTS IT ALREADY WALKS THROUGH — IT IS A FREE
  OUTSIDE ROUTE — AND PARTITION THE RESULT INTO THREE BUCKETS, NOT TWO.** Any construction-chain
  or member-access witness for a derived class necessarily crosses its base subobjects, so
  wherever some *other* machinery has already laid out one of those bases you have a graded
  population for nothing, produced by a route the new witness does not consume. Measured: five
  such bases covered 51 classes, giving **500 cells inside a committed field, 0 straddling a
  committed boundary, 2423 in a committed gap**. Three things make it a real calibration:
  - **The gap bucket must be reported and NOT graded.** A cell landing where the older artifact
    claims nothing is neither agreement nor contradiction; folding it into either side corrupts
    the measure, and it is usually the biggest bucket — here 2423 against 500. It is the
    *payload*: the new witness reaching where the old one did not.
  - **Require agreement, not merely absence of contradiction.** A zero `inside` count must raise.
    Otherwise a witness that is systematically misaligned — every cell landing in gaps — passes
    with a clean sheet.
  - **Put the arm BEFORE the write and poison it on real data.** Shifting one cell two bytes per
    gradeable class fires it (`7 cell(s) straddle`), and because the check sits between the
    harvest and the emit, the poisoned run leaves no artifact to revert. That is the "a run that
    RAISED must not have its output promoted" rule solved by ORDERING instead of by cleanup, and
    it is strictly better because it cannot be forgotten.
- **A REDUCING OPERATION IS WHERE AN EVIDENCE SET GOES TO DIE — READ WHAT YOUR SWEEPS DISCARD,
  NOT ONLY WHAT THEY EMIT.** The skip-counter rule above is about rows a sweep declined to
  produce. This is the case where the sweep *did* the work, on the *whole* population, and
  threw the result away one line later. Measured: a body scanner tracked every store through a
  register its alias tracker resolved to the object, computed `offset + width` for each, and
  kept only the **maximum**, committed as a scalar `ctor_write_max`. 125 of the 133 classes in
  the project's next open lead carried that row — so 125 complete per-offset write sets had been
  measured and discarded, round after round, while a new sweep was being designed to obtain
  exactly them. Two things make this worth a standing check rather than an anecdote:
  - **The reducer's own artifact proves the traversal already reaches the population.** A
    committed `max`, `count` or `any` column is a receipt saying *"this code visited every one of
    these and looked at the quantity you now want"*. Grep your producers for `max(`, `+= 1` and
    early `break` before scoping any round that proposes to go and measure something.
  - **Recovering it is ADDITIVE and must be proven so, not argued so.** Append the cells at the
    exact site that already computes the reduced value, so no existing key's value can move —
    then run the stability harness anyway, because "this cannot have changed anything" is the
    reasoning this document refuses everywhere else. Here: 47 producers, 0 raised, 0 CHANGED and 55
    version-only restamps across 96 artifacts.
- **PRICE A PROPOSED WITNESS IN COVERAGE, NEVER IN SPAN — AND A ONE-EXAMPLE CAVEAT IS NOT A
  MEASUREMENT.** "Measure a proposed mechanism's REACH before building it" has a unit, and
  picking the wrong one flatters the round. Measured on the same population: the committed
  high-water marks reach a median **31.9%** of each class's size, which reads like a workable
  layout; the bytes those same writes actually **cover** are **2.3%**, because one store far out
  produces a large maximum and a tiny footprint. Span is an upper bound on coverage and the gap
  between them is the entire question. The sibling witness failed the same way in the other
  direction: a previous round had called its tiling "sparse" on the strength of one example, and
  over the whole population it covers **2.7%** of bytes with 106 of 133 classes under 5% — the
  difference between "supplement it" and "it cannot carry the round".
- **A CONSTRUCTION WRITE SET IS A PROPERTY OF THE CHAIN, NOT OF THE BODY — FOLLOW THE CALLS
  WHOSE RECEIVER THE SCAN RESOLVED TO THE OBJECT, AND READ THE QUIET RESULT AS THE TELL RATHER
  THAN AS A BROKEN TRACKER.** `references/cpp-abi.md` says a vptr-store chain names ancestors because MSVC
  deletes unobservable stores. The layout consequence is the same mechanism read forward: MSVC
  emits a derived constructor as `call base_ctor; mov [this], own_vftable`, so essentially all
  field initialisation lives in the **base's** body. A flat per-body write set therefore reports
  **one** tracked cell on a 936-byte class, which reads as a broken tracker and is not. Follow
  the calls whose receiver the scan resolved to the object — delta-0 by construction, so sound
  under single inheritance — depth-capped and cycle-guarded: coverage went **5.0% → 69.8%**,
  median **77.6%** per class, 78 of 125 classes above 75%. Two riders:
  - **Another artifact usually already records WHY the witness was quiet.** The size artifact's
    witness column read `ancestor:ctor_write_max` for most of this population: the size was known
    to be inherited, therefore so were the fields. Nobody had put the two side by side. When a
    witness comes back surprisingly quiet, search your own artifacts for the explanation before
    theorising about the tracker or the data.
  - **Say what the coverage number is NOT.** It is bytes touched by an observed construction-time
    access — offsets and widths — not fields identified, typed or named; and the chain admits
    non-constructor callees on purpose, because a write through `this` proves the cell is in the
    object whoever emitted it. Splitting those bytes between a class and its bases is a separate
    step with its own rule.
- **Diminishing returns in one vein is a signal to change AXIS, not to push harder, and the
  trigger is measurable.** When a round costs a full apply-and-verify cycle to decide four
  bytes, and the residue is a handful of items each needing its own bespoke witness, that
  population is exhausted *for that method* — the remaining information is somewhere else.
  Cheap axis changes that repay: rank functions by CALL-SITE FAN-IN rather than by class
  membership (measured: the two highest-fan-in unnamed functions in one binary were the
  game's own allocator and its free, 905 call sites between them, invisible to every
  class-oriented view and already sitting in a script constant, unapplied); ask what a
  thing IS rather than how big it is; and look at the populations no route reaches at all.
  The point is not that breadth beats depth — it is that a stalled depth metric is
  evidence about your METHOD, not about the binary.
- **Before extending a rule to a new evidence source, compare what the RULE requires against
  what the evidence already proved — the extension is often free, and if it is not, that is
  the moment to stop.** Measured: a containment rule (`sizeof(base) <= sizeof(descendant) <=
  alloc(descendant)`) needed only ANCESTRY, while the evidence it was being offered — edges
  from a destructor-chain witness — had already cleared a strictly *higher* bar (immediacy)
  to be recorded at all. So it qualified *a fortiori*: no new soundness argument, no new
  calibration design, one row changed and a class went from an open interval to an exact
  size. The round was short precisely because that comparison was made first instead of the
  argument being re-derived from scratch. The same question asked the other way is the stop
  signal: when the new use needs MORE than the evidence proved, do not extend — that is a new
  witness wearing an old rule's clothes.
  - **Re-run the rule's calibration over the COMBINED population, and demonstrate it firing
    THERE.** A calibration that only ever sees the original evidence passes vacuously on the
    new. Here the poison had to point a *fabricated new-source edge* at a known-size base to
    prove the check reached the added rows at all.
  - **Give the ground-truth arm a NEGATIVE TWIN, and assert its diff is exactly the expected
    size.** A flag that re-runs the decider *without* the new evidence must fail to reach the
    result, and the two runs must differ in exactly the rows claimed. Otherwise "the value is
    now pinned" is a fact about the artifact, not evidence that the new source caused it.
  - **A diff of only provenance cells is the OPPOSITE of churn — say so in the write-up.**
    Two rows here changed `witnesses` and `note` with no value moving: the classes now cite
    their real base rather than their own constructor. A skimming reader sees noise; the next
    reader following the citation sees the difference.
- **A hardcoded population count in a TEST is the same defect as one in a report, and worse
  placed.** A harness baseline asserting "15 hubs" went stale the moment a round legitimately
  added a sixteenth — inside a check that *passes*, so nothing announced its expiry. Derive
  it from the population function the code under test already exposes.
- **Two witnesses that are both LOWER BOUNDS on the same relation must be ANDed, never
  required to AGREE.** The instinct on acquiring a second route to a fact is to gate on the
  two agreeing. That is right for witnesses that can err in both directions and **wrong** for
  the common case where each can only MISS evidence, never invent it — there, a
  symmetric-agreement gate fires on the perfectly normal case of one route being quieter than
  the other. Measured: two routes to "does this class have a subclass" — recorded parentage
  (from constructor vptr stores) and destructor-chain descendancy — were gated on agreement
  and the gate raised on two classes. **The data was right and the gate was wrong**: both
  routes depend on a compiler-emitted store that is *deleted where nothing observes it*, and
  the two get deleted in different functions, so each can wrongly say "no subclass" and
  neither can wrongly say "has one".

  Split the one question into two and the asymmetry becomes usable:
  - **SOUNDNESS** — does the new route ever report a relation the established one
    *contradicts*? This is what licenses it to speak at all, and it is graded only on the
    sub-population the established route can speak about. (Here: 309 of 309 gradeable pairs
    confirmed, 0 contradicted; the 35 pairs touching unclassified entities are *counted*, not
    graded, because there is nothing to grade them against.)
  - **PAYLOAD** — does it ADD a relation the established one missed? For a negative claim
    ("no subclass exists") only an addition can overturn it.

  Then take the **AND**: the negative claim holds only where *every* route is silent. And
  **demonstrate each conjunct separately** — remove a known instance from one route and
  require the other to hold the line, then reverse it. Without those two arms there is no
  evidence the second route was load-bearing rather than decorative.
- **When a rule's CALIBRATION cannot exist in the population you are extending it to, SPLIT
  it and say which half is which — do not manufacture a substitute.** A rule has a *claim*
  and a *precondition*, and they can be calibrated in different places. Measured: the claim
  ("for a subclass-free class, the allocation size is exact") could only be calibrated where
  classes have a size known independently of allocation; the target population has no such
  class and structurally never will. The tempting substitute — grading the rule against the
  members already decided — is **circular**, because those were decided by the very witness
  under test. State the split, calibrate the precondition where you can (it was measurable
  there, and more strongly), and **assert the structural zero** so the split retires itself
  the day the population gains an independent witness.
- **When a round breaks an existing test arm, repair the arm's PURPOSE — never delete it or
  relax its expectation.** Measured: a new pin rule overwrote the value an older arm asserted,
  so the arm stopped testing the route it was written for while still passing a weaker check.
  The fix is to run the old arm with the new rule *disabled* (which is why the new rule needs
  a flag anyway, for the two-step diff) and to add a companion arm stating the **precedence**
  between the two rules explicitly — otherwise the ordering of two `if`s is the only record
  of a decision.
- **A rule built for one population must be offered to its SIBLING populations.** Measured:
  a "leaf class allocates exactly its own size" rule decided 57 classes in one population
  and was never extended to a sibling population with an identical evidence shape (same
  allocation witness, same constructor witness), leaving five leaf classes open whose sizes
  its own arithmetic would have decided immediately. This is the "two consumers of one
  rule" hazard pointed at populations instead of code paths, and it is invisible because
  each population's artifact looks internally consistent. When a rule lands, enumerate
  every population carrying the evidence it consumes and record which ones you did not
  extend it to, and why.
  - **The way to offer it is to MOVE it to one copy — not to copy it, and not to re-derive
    it — and to leave its CALIBRATION where it was demonstrated.** Measured on the second
    occurrence of this hazard in the same project: the sibling tool had grown its own
    narrower version of a base-selection rule, which could not walk through an
    intermediate entity carrying no layout, and so *raised* where the shared rule would
    have walked on. Moving the rule to the shared library cost one insert and two renames;
    the five calibration arms stayed in the original tool's selftest, pointed at the moved
    copy, so the rule relocated and its evidence did not have to be rebuilt. A second copy
    would have doubled the calibration debt and guaranteed the two drift.
- **A PRECONDITION THAT RAISES takes the whole round down with it — where a script is
  DECIDING SCOPE, express it as a printed exclusion; keep the raise only where the state
  already exists.** The mutation-safety rules in this document push everything toward
  raising, and that is right for *damage*. It is wrong for *scoping*, and the two look
  identical in code. Measured: a struct applier raised on one entity that had never been
  named and whose parent had no decided layout — so a bare DRY RUN aborted, one un-nameable
  entity blocked the three that were ready, and the abort landed **before** the round's
  before/after payoff measurement, destroying it. Both conditions became exclusions printed
  with a reason and a count. What makes that a repair rather than a loosening is the
  distinction it draws: for an entity that has **already been applied**, the same conditions
  still raise, because its type exists, so a missing namespace or a vanished prefix source is
  damage. Ask of every precondition: *is this the script choosing what to do, or the program
  telling me something broke?*
- **A WALK added beside a single-step rule must inherit the single-step rule's RAISES.**
  Widening "take the base" into "walk the chain" is the common shape of the fix above, and
  the quiet failure is that the walk *stops* where the single step *raised*. Measured: the
  single-step form raised on more than one recorded base (a single-inheritance
  contradiction); the walk was initially written to stop there and return what it had. That
  is a loosening the two-step diff **cannot** see, because the diff compares outcomes on
  data where the contradiction does not occur. Point the existing poison at both functions.
- **A rule change proven INERT everywhere is indistinguishable from one that does nothing —
  so pin what it DID change with a negative twin.** The two-step diff coming back
  byte-identical is what licenses the change, and it is also exactly what a no-op looks
  like. Add an arm requiring the one case the change was made for to succeed under the new
  rule and to fail under the old one, and derive it from the program with a guard, so the
  round that finally fixes that case retires the arm by name instead of leaving it inert.
- **Running a sibling tool purely as an INERTNESS PROOF is also a CENSUS of that tool, and
  that is where the next orphaned mutator is found.** The stability harness
  (`references/assertions.md`) drives read-only sweeps and structurally cannot run appliers, so an applier's queue of work grows
  silently. Measured: a sibling applier was invoked only to show a moved rule had not changed
  its behaviour, and its dry run reported an entity that had become eligible two rounds
  earlier under a rule added one round after that — an approved-census round nobody had
  noticed. Whenever you touch shared machinery, run *every* consumer's dry run and read the
  population line, not just the pass/fail.
- **PRICE A QUEUED ROUND AGAINST THE PROGRAM BEFORE APPLYING IT — a plan's premises decay,
  and the decay is invisible from inside the plan.** A round described as ready in three
  separate notes had four premises refuted by one read-only census script: two call-site
  counts stale by ~200; one "rename" that was really a MERGE into a namespace an earlier
  round had already created from the same evidence; one that needed no rename at all (the
  class was already named — only the *table* lacked a namespace, which turned a blocked
  struct apply into a one-row artifact edit); and two names colliding with types the
  binary's own demangler had built from export signatures. Every one is a fact about the
  program, and none is reachable by re-reading the notes — which is where all three
  descriptions came from. Two follow-ons:
  - **A name collision is EVIDENCE, not an obstacle.** It usually means an earlier round
    reached the same conclusion by another route. Read what is already there before deciding
    what the round does; the operation is often smaller than planned.
  - **But census the colliding name's TIER.** Measured on the same pair: the pre-existing
    names carried the *analyzer* tier and were absent from the agent-name ledger, because
    they predated the tagging discipline — 22 such names across 7 namespaces. Treating "the
    name already exists" as corroboration would have been self-corroboration with years
    between the two halves.
- **WHEN A RESEMBLANCE ARGUMENT IS ACCUMULATING, FIND THE ARTEFACT THE CANDIDATE WOULD HAVE
  LEFT BEHIND AND CHECK WHETHER IT IS THERE.** Attributing a recovered design to a known
  codebase gets easier the more traits you list, and listing traits is not testing. Measured: a
  game's allocator matched a specific published engine on four behaviours including one unique
  to that engine's later version, and the case was becoming persuasive. Two structural tests
  settled it in minutes — *does the bookkeeping live in the struct that engine uses?* (no: four
  loose globals) and *is the magic value that engine writes past each block actually written?*
  (no: across 113 instructions the only constants stored were `0` and one address). The second
  dissolved the strongest coincidence in the case, because the `+4` everyone had read as that
  engine's fingerprint turned out to compensate the allocator's own round-DOWN two lines
  earlier. **A single absent artefact outweighs any number of shared behaviours** — and note
  which way this failed: the resemblance argument was manufacturing a conclusion, not hiding one.
- **Measure a proposed mechanism's REACH before building it.** A cheap probe that counts
  how many targets a route could possibly reach costs minutes and routinely refutes the
  round you were about to spend a day on. Two measured examples from one session: a plan
  to lay out ~229 classes died when a five-line count showed only 56 were reachable at
  all and 12 of the 16 usable ones were already done; and an interprocedural type
  inference died when its own calibration — the cases where the inference could be
  checked against ground truth — disagreed 18 times in 54. Run the counting probe first;
  a refuted round is a cheap round.

  **And measure reach over the whole population, not over the census you already have** —
  an existing census is often a lower bound *by construction*, in a way its summary line
  does not admit. One here enumerated adjacent pairs of recovered tables, so any instance
  whose tail fell below the noise-filter threshold was dropped before the census could see
  it; scoping the round from its 7 findings would have been scoping from a filtered view.
  The whole-population probe happened to confirm exactly 7 and 0 new, which is the outcome
  that makes the check look unnecessary and is precisely why it has to be run.

### Undefined code and the byte-pattern engine

- **A BYTE PATTERN'S FALSE-POSITIVE RATE IS DIRECTLY COUNTABLE AGAINST THE FUNCTIONS YOU
  ALREADY HAVE — count it before mining anything.** Mining function-start patterns from a
  program's own corpus (`Ghidra/Features/BytePatterns`,
  `ClosedPatternRowObject.mineClosedPatterns`) is the obvious way to attack undefined code, and
  the obvious way to price it — how many candidates would it produce — is the wrong axis.
  **A wrong function start ABSORBS the true function after it**, so the mechanism damages the
  population it is meant to grow, and the function count rises either way. Precision decides the
  round, and your existing functions *are* the graded set: every occurrence of a candidate
  prologue inside a defined body but **not at its entry** is a place the pattern would fire
  wrongly. Measured on one 1999 MSVC/x86 binary with 5,629 known starts: `c3909090`
  (`RET; NOP NOP NOP`) is **54 starts against 3,230 interiors — 1.6% precision**; `c2040090`
  is 29 against 972; only **5 of the top 25** reach 95%. And the vocabulary itself refused the
  round before precision even mattered: **1,950 distinct 4-byte prologues over 5,629 starts,
  top 25 covering 34.1%**. Derive the count two independent ways (per-entry reads, and a bulk
  image scan classified against the same start set) and **raise if they disagree** — that is the
  only thing that catches a misaligned bulk read, which would silently invalidate every number.
- **PRICE THE UNDEFINED-CODE SEARCH SPACE BY CONTENT, NOT BY RANGE COUNT — the filler
  dominates, and the headline number is a span.** `Listing.getUndefinedRanges` over
  `Memory.getExecuteSet()` is the right enumeration and its total is not the population.
  Measured: "5,321 ranges / 87,713 bytes", carried across several rounds, resolved into
  **5,033 ranges / 44,440 bytes of pure `0xCC`/`0x00`/`0x90` alignment padding**, 52 ranges under
  8 bytes, and a candidate-bearing residue of **236 ranges / 43,139 bytes**. 95% of the ranges
  could never hold a function. Classify each range by content before scoping anything on it.
- **`PseudoDisassembler.isValidSubroutine` IS NOT A DISCRIMINATOR — 100% RECALL, 72%
  FALSE-ACCEPT — AND ONLY THE NEGATIVE TWIN SAYS SO.** `ghidra.app.util.PseudoDisassembler` is
  genuinely read-only (its own javadoc: creates no references or symbols, needs no transaction),
  which makes it the right instrument to reach for and the easy one to over-trust. Graded both
  ways on one binary: **400 of 400** sampled known function starts accepted
  (`isValidSubroutine(addr, allowExistingCode=True)`), and **288 of 400** sampled known function
  *interiors* accepted too. So "N undisassembled ranges decode cleanly" is close to
  information-free — a recall-only calibration would have published 224 such ranges as a finding.
  This is the skill's "calibrate by positive agreement, not only absence of contradiction" rule
  pointed at its mirror image: here the recall arm passes trivially and the *precision* arm is
  the one that refuses the instrument.
- **A GAP BOUNDED BY TWO DEFINED FUNCTIONS IS A SAFER PLACE TO CREATE A FUNCTION THAN OPEN
  BYTES — measure the bounding before accepting a stated hazard.** "A false positive absorbs the
  true following function" is the correct objection to pattern-driven function creation in open
  bytes, and it is **void** where the following function already exists in the database.
  Measured: of 236 candidate ranges, **221 were preceded by a defined function ending in a flow
  terminator and 210 were followed immediately by a defined function START** — whole functions
  sitting in bounded gaps of an otherwise contiguous `.text`. The bounding is a safety property
  no byte pattern supplies, and it is one cheap census away.
- **ASK WHETHER AN UNDISASSEMBLED BOUNDARY TRUNCATES A DEFINED FUNCTION — it is cheap and it
  grades your whole evidence base at once.** If a defined body stops at such a boundary while its
  last instruction still **falls through**, that function is cut short in the database, and every
  witness computed by walking function bodies — write sets, construction extents, read/write
  cells, and every layout resting on them — has been reading a partial body and reporting a
  complete answer. Nothing warns. Ask each instruction's own `FlowType` (`isTerminal()`,
  `isJump()`, `hasFallthrough()`), never a mnemonic list, and **calibrate both ways over the
  whole corpus first** — measured, 5,628 of 5,629 defined functions end in a flow terminator and
  1 falls through, which is what makes the answer (**0 of 236 truncated**) a measurement rather
  than a property of the probe. On this binary it was the most valuable thing the round produced,
  and it was a reassurance, not a defect.
- **SEPARATE FEASIBILITY FROM VALUE, AND MEASURE BOTH.** The same population was recoverable
  *and* worthless: **11 references reach all 43,139 residue bytes, every one `DATA`, none a
  `CALL`** — linker-retained code the game never runs, appearing in no tick. A round can be
  perfectly feasible and still not worth running; a pricing probe that reports only reach has
  answered half the question. Say which half you measured.

- **TO ASK WHAT A SHIPPED ANALYZER WOULD DO, BORROW ITS MACHINERY — DO NOT REIMPLEMENT ITS
  RULES.** This is the "check for a built-in before writing your own" rule applied to a *question*
  rather than to a task, and it is the higher-value form. Measured: the question "can Ghidra's
  shipped function-start patterns fire anywhere in these undisassembled bytes" would have required
  hand-rolling ditted-bit matching, pre/post pattern pairing, a fixed-bit budget and four
  post-match prerequisites — four chances to be subtly wrong, each failing in the direction that
  MANUFACTURES a finding. What it actually takes:
  - `ghidra.app.analyzers.Patterns.getPatternDecisionTree()` → `findPatternFiles(program, tree)`
    — **ask which pattern files apply to this program** rather than assuming; it resolves through
    `patternconstraints.xml` and a `ProgramDecisionTree`.
  - `ghidra.util.bytesearch.Pattern.readPatterns(resourceFile, arrayList, patternFactory)` —
    parses them, and `PatternPairSet.createFinalPatterns` applies the bit budget internally.
  - `MemoryBytePatternSearcher(name, patternList)` + `setSearchExecutableOnly(true)` +
    `searchAll(program, monitor)` — the same `BulkPatternSearcher` the analyzer runs.

  **The seam that keeps it read-only is the `MatchAction`, not the search.** The production
  `PatternFactory` is `FunctionStartAnalyzer` *itself*, and instantiating it is NOT read-only —
  its `applyActionToSet` calls `func.setNoReturn(true)` and writes an `AddressSetPropertyMap`.
  Supply your own `PatternFactory` (a plain interface: `getMatchActionByName`,
  `getPostRuleByName`, so `@JImplements` works from PyGhidra) returning `MatchAction`s whose
  `apply` records and whose `restoreXml` keeps the XML attributes — those attributes carry the
  analyzer's extra prerequisites and decide whether a match is unconditional. `DummyMatchAction`
  is the shipped no-op template.
- **A PATTERN FILE IS A CROSS PRODUCT FILTERED BY AN INFORMATION BUDGET, NOT A LIST OF BYTE
  STRINGS.** `PatternPairSet.createFinalPatterns` builds a final pattern from a (prepattern,
  postpattern) pair only if `postcheck >= postBitsOfCheck` **and**
  `precheck + postcheck >= totalBitsOfCheck`, both counting FIXED (non-ditted) bits. Measured, and
  it demolished an apparently perfect counter-example: thirteen NOPs followed by `SUB ESP,0x10`
  matches the shipped `0x90` prepattern against the shipped `0x83ec 0.....00` postpattern — and
  `0x90` supplies 8 fixed bits while that postpattern supplies 19, so at `totalbits="32"` **the
  pair is never built.** Reading the prologue bytes can never reveal this; reading
  `createFinalPatterns` reveals it in one line.
- **A SHIPPED PATTERN CAN BE STRUCTURALLY INCAPABLE OF FIRING WHERE YOU ARE LOOKING, AND ITS HIT
  COUNT STILL READS AS A FINDING.** Post-match attributes are prerequisites, checked in
  `FunctionStartAnalyzer.checkPreRequisites` long after the bytes match: `validcode="function"`
  requires an **existing** function at the address; `after="func|inst|data|ptr|def"` runs
  `checkAfterName`; `validcode="N"` runs `PseudoDisassembler.checkValidSubroutine`. Measured: 628
  of 640 matches inside undisassembled bytes were the `<data>0xcc</data>` `__break` pattern, which
  carries `validcode="function"` — impossible in undefined bytes by definition — and all 628 were
  INT3 filler. Counted naively that is a 640-strong false positive on a census of padding. **Read
  each pattern's attributes before counting its hits**, and note where a refusal is *structural*
  rather than incidental: `checkAfterName`'s fallback `pureDataReferencesOnly` opens with
  `if (!referencesTo.hasNext()) return false;`, so **no references is a refusal, not a pass**.
- **CALIBRATE A BORROWED ENGINE THE SAME WAY YOU CALIBRATE A WITNESS.** A "0 matches in the region
  I care about" result is worth nothing until the engine has been shown to fire where it should.
  The arm: run it over the whole program and require a large share of its matches to land on
  function starts that already exist (measured: 1,205 of 2,905, **41.5%**). Raise if the file
  resolution returns nothing, if 0 final patterns are built, if the search returns 0 matches, or
  if 0 land on a known start — each of those turns the headline zero into a fact about your
  wiring rather than about the program.
### Identity, joins and populations

- **Do not classify a population member by what it is NOT.** "Not a table start, therefore
  interior to a table" is only sound if the tables tile the region — and recovered runs
  almost never tile anything (262 gaps totalling ~37KB here). The wrong label is invisible
  because it is usually right. Compute the actual extents and emit the third bucket
  (`start` / `interior` / `gap`); the gap cases are where the surprises live, since an
  address in a gap may sit inside something the noise filter discarded entirely.
- **A short name is not an identity — join on ADDRESSES, not names.** Demangled short names
  collide across a hierarchy: an override shares its base's name, so two different tables can
  look identical.
  - **And a NAMING ROUND is what proves whether you actually did.** Measured: applying four
    long-established class identities broke **five** separate checks at once, each of which
    had memorised a spelling where it meant an entity — an approved-scope constant recording
    which node a previous round was authorised to add (by its old label), a
    `startswith("UNKNOWN_")` standing in for "is this an unnamed class" (a *tier* question),
    two tests, one of them a **poison that silently went inert**, and two diagnostics. All
    five were repaired by resolving the table ADDRESS through a helper that had already been
    made rename-proof once, for a different class — the fix existed and had simply never
    travelled to the sites that needed it. If your project has never renamed anything, treat
    every name-keyed join as unproven rather than as working.
  - **The dangerous one is a label a producer emits for an entity it CREATES.** A sweep that
    folds in a new node looked its label up in a map built *before* the fold, so the one node
    it adds always fell through to the synthetic `UNKNOWN_0x…` spelling. Harmless while that
    node had no other name; the moment the class was decided, that artifact disagreed with
    every other artifact, a downstream rule joined the two **by name**, and a class silently
    regressed from an exact size to an open interval. Nothing errored.
- **ADJUDICATE A RELABEL BY ASKING WHETHER THE ARTIFACT IS THE OLD ONE WITH THE NAMES
  SUBSTITUTED — a positional diff cannot answer that.** Renaming changes SORT ORDER, so a
  row-by-row comparison reports nearly every row of a re-sorted file as changed and the real
  change hides in the noise. Normalise both sides, substitute the renamed labels, sort, and
  compare as MULTISETS. Measured: 10 of 14 changed artifacts were provably pure relabels,
  two more differed only in the ordering of names inside list-valued cells, and exactly two
  carried the regression worth finding — which had been one line among fourteen.
- **Population counts depend on the symbol filter, silently.** In this project
  `getExternalFunctions()` returned 134 imports, not the expected 136, because two of them
  exist only as `SymbolType.Label` and not as `Function` symbols — so that API cannot see
  them at all. Verify a population before building on its size.
- **A hand-written seed list can contain structurally inert entries.** Of 28 marker
  imports seeded into a call-graph closure, 2 were unreachable by the mechanism consuming
  them, so the effective seed set was 26. Check that each seed is actually visible to the
  API that will consume it, and report the effective count, not the written one.
- **`Function.getName()` is unqualified; `getName(True)` includes the namespace.**
  Comparing the wrong one against a namespace-qualified expectation makes a check
  *structurally unable to match* — it reports 0/N forever and reads as a failing sweep
  rather than a broken test. This exact bug produced four dead checks in this project.
  Likewise raw mangled names and demangled short names are different string spaces that
  never intersect; converting one to the other is required before comparison.

### Samples, headers and new witness kinds

- **A PINNED SAMPLE MEASURES THE ROUND THAT CHOSE IT, FOREVER — AND IT FAILS QUIETLY, BY
  UNDERSTATING.** Measured: an applier scored its own payoff over five literal function addresses
  picked several rounds earlier for a different class. The round that finally mattered applied 13
  fields witnessed in **ten other bodies, none of them in the sample**, so the applier reported
  "no change" and concluded it had bought nothing. The number was true and the claim was false:
  it was a statement about the sample. **When a measurement over a fixed sample returns zero,
  verify the sample intersects the change before reporting the zero** — and prefer a sample
  DERIVED from the same artifact the round is applying, so it grows with the evidence. Here that
  was 5 → 38 bodies and a real payoff of 110 lines. Same shape as a literal row index beside an
  editable header, or a pinned census beside a growing population: **a literal sitting next to
  something that evolves.** Sweep for the shape rather than fixing the instance — in that repo,
  four such lists existed and exactly one was the defect; naming the other three (one already
  derived, two pinned on purpose) is what turns a worry into a closed answer.
- **THE SCRIPT'S OWN WARNING IS THE FINDING, AND IT IS ONE LINE FROM BEING IGNORED.** That
  applier printed *"the payoff did NOT increase ... check the sample reaches bodies these types
  are ON."* Everything needed was on screen; the available failure was to read the clean
  invariants and move on. **An honesty check earns nothing unless the round budgets the
  follow-up** — a printed caveat nobody acts on is worse than absent, because it documents that
  you were told.
- **`csv.DictReader` SILENTLY COLLAPSES A DUPLICATE FIELDNAME AND SHIFTS EVERY COLUMN AFTER IT.**
  Measured: a header carried **10 names over 9 values** (one name twice), so a late column had
  been quietly returning a different field's data — in that case the program version — for
  however long the defect had existed. No exception, no warning, and the values are all
  plausible strings. **Guard the header explicitly**: assert the names are unique and that their
  count equals the first data row's field count. Both are one line, and nothing else in the
  stack will tell you.
- **BEFORE ADDING A WITNESS KIND, NAME THE POPULATION IT ALONE REACHES.** Measured: a producer's
  four existing kinds were all constructor initialisations and serialiser records, so **a field
  written elsewhere and never saved was invisible to every one of them** — and the artifact
  said "no witness reaches these bytes" over a region the game writes seven dwords into every
  tick. The note was true of the kinds it had and false about the program. A fifth kind is worth
  its cost exactly when that sentence can be written for it; if it only agrees with what the
  others already see, it is a confidence upgrade, not a new witness. And **a new kind arrives
  with its exclusion rules already paid for by earlier rounds — do not re-derive them at
  intake**, because a consumer that re-derives an upstream adjudication is a second copy of one
  rule, and the two drift.

### Register conventions you "know" are per-function facts

- **`EBP` IS NOT A FRAME POINTER JUST BECAUSE IT USUALLY IS.** With frame-pointer omission (MSVC
  `/Oy`, on by default at `/O2`) `EBP` is an ordinary general register, and compilers use it to
  hold whatever is hot — including an object pointer. Measured: a probe classifying `rep movsd`
  destinations hardcoded `("ESP", "EBP")` as frame registers, and so read
  `LEA EDI,[EBP + 0x7c]` — the copy that establishes a 268-byte embedded record at
  `<object> + 0x7c`, the single fact the whole analysis line was built on — as *"a write to a
  stack local at offset 124."* **And 124 is 0x7c in decimal**, so the wrong answer looked
  plausible. Decide the frame register **per function**, from the prologue (`PUSH EBP;
  MOV EBP,ESP`), not per program. The same caution applies to any "this register means X"
  assumption: `ESI`/`EDI` as string pointers, `ECX` as `this`, `EBX` as a preserved base — all are
  conventions the optimizer is free to ignore between calls.
- **A SMALL DELTA IN A CENSUS IS NOT EVIDENCE THAT THE DEFECT WAS SMALL.** Fixing the above moved
  **3 of 176** destination classifications — under 2% — and one of the three was the fact the
  entire arc rested on. **Grade a correction by WHICH rows moved, not how many.** The instinct to
  shrug at a 2% change is exactly wrong when the population is heterogeneous in importance.
- **CALIBRATE ON THE PROPERTY THE PROBE EXISTS TO MEASURE, NOT A CORRELATE OF IT.** That probe
  carried a deliberate calibration: re-derive the hand reading that motivated it. It asked for *a
  copy of the right SIZE in the right function* and found seven — and never asked where any of
  them wrote to, which was the entire output of the round that added destination resolution. It
  therefore **passed for two rounds while the one row it was calibrating against was
  misclassified.** A calibration that cannot fail when the headline is wrong is decoration. Pin
  the output, not an input that correlates with it.
- **QUERY YOUR OWN ARTIFACT FOR A FACT YOU ALREADY KNOW BEFORE TRUSTING IT FOR ONE YOU DO NOT.**
  The defect surfaced only because a later task needed the artifact to answer a different
  question, and the row that should obviously have been there was absent. That is a one-line check
  against a known answer, and it caught a two-round defect that every internal consistency check
  had passed.

### An artifact carrying program-state columns must be regenerated AFTER its own round's apply — and if a column flips, fix the COLUMN

**Measured.** A round produced a new artifact, then applied types to the program, then ran the
stability harness — which reported the artifact `CHANGED`. It had: the sweep recorded per-class
program state (`does a type exist`, `which route applies`) and the round's own apply had changed
exactly that.

The tempting fixes are both wrong. Excusing the artifact from the harness removes the only thing
that would notice it going stale later; annotating "expect churn here" is the same thing written
politely. The two fixes that were right:

- **Make the column mean something stable.** `struct_route` was rewritten to name the route a class
  *belongs to*, not whether the work has been done yet — so it reads the same before and after the
  apply. A column that answers "what kind of thing is this" is stable; one that answers "is it
  finished" is a progress indicator and does not belong beside evidence.
- **Make the sweep and the applier share ONE state machine.** They had independent copies of the
  same rule and disagreed about what `applied` meant. Two producers with private copies of one rule
  is the divergence hazard, inside a single repo — and here the applier re-derives the rule and
  **raises if it disagrees with the artifact's own column**, so the two cannot drift apart quietly.

Residual, and worth stating rather than hiding: some columns are irreducibly program-state
(`type_state` here). Those change once, at the apply, and are stable thereafter — so **regenerate
and commit the post-apply version**, and expect exactly one churned generation per mutating round.

### One bracket's raise costs a reach fault too — expect two faults with one cause

**Measured twice, in different rounds.** A probe pins an absolute whole-program invariant (the
datatype count). A round legitimately changes it; the probe raises — the bracket working. But **a
producer that raises does not regenerate its artifact**, so that artifact is then counted
`unchanged` with nothing having re-derived it, and the reach adjudicator reports it as a second,
apparently unrelated fault.

A round that changes the pinned quantity should expect **two complaints and one cause**, and must
not go hunting for a second one. Write the pairing down beside the bracket, because the second
fault names a completely different file and reads like an independent problem.

And when re-pinning: **account for the delta BY NAME, never by subtraction.** Keep a per-round list
of the names the apply is expected to have added and assert the list is present (here 15 of 15),
and have the *applier itself* assert the added name-set across its own mutation — so the count and
the account cannot drift apart on a replay the way a bare number lets them.

### A change log is not a census — and two nearly-right accounts are worse than none

**Measured.** A whole-program datatype bracket moved **+136** on a round that applied *no types at
all* (naming functions into new class namespaces materialises a placeholder type per namespace).
The standing rule is that re-pinning such a bracket requires accounting for the delta **by name**,
so two reconstructions were tried: counting placeholder types among the affected classes gave
**140**; asking the project's own applied-types ledger which of those already existed gave **138**.

Both were close enough to write up. Neither was right, and the reason generalises: **that ledger
records what YOUR rounds created. It is a change log, not a census** — it cannot see a type that
arrived with the importer, the demangler, or an analyzer. Deriving "what existed before" from a
record of "what I did" is only valid if you are the only writer, and on a Ghidra project you never
are.

**A 2-to-4 row residual is exactly the size of a real defect and exactly small enough to round
off.** So measure instead of reconstructing: restore the pre-round snapshot into a scratch project
file, enumerate the full name census on both sides, and diff. Result here: 136 added, 0 removed,
all placeholders — and the probe **asserts** that `added - removed` reconciles with the count
rather than leaving a reader to eyeball it.

Two riders:

- **Census everything the invariant counts, not just the interesting kind.** A datatype count
  counts pointers, arrays and function definitions too. A struct-only census would have reported a
  residual it structurally could not explain, and the natural next move — widening the tolerance —
  would have destroyed the check.
- **Snapshot-diffing is cheap and nobody does it.** The snapshot already exists because the
  checkpoint discipline created it. Restoring it read-only into a scratch file, diffing, and
  deleting the scratch is a few dozen lines, and it answers "what actually changed" for any
  program-wide quantity — permanently, instead of per-round detective work.

### A measured zero needs its mechanism, or it is a bug you have not found yet

**Measured, twice in one round.** "No ancestor's exported symbols name any of these vtable slots:
**0 of 179**" was produced, doubted on sight, and re-run — the first version had walked only the
*immediate* base, which was a genuine defect in the reader. The zero survived the fix, and only
then was it worth anything, because it acquired an explanation: the relevant ancestor's
mangled-named slots stop at index 151, while every override in question sits at slot 38 or in the
152–176 range that is the class's own extension.

A zero with a mechanism is a finding you can build on. A zero without one is indistinguishable from
a scanner that looked in the wrong place — and it reads as *"nothing to find here"* to every later
round. **Before recording any zero, state the mechanism that produces it and check that the
mechanism predicts the non-zeros too.**

### A wrong join key produces a MISSING answer, not a wrong one — re-key before believing an absence

The sibling of the rule above, and the more dangerous half. A mislabelled row invites a challenge:
somebody reads `CHoverTruck` where they expected `CVehicle` and asks why. **An absence invites
nothing.** Nobody audits a blank.

**Measured.** A harvester attributed each function to a class through a *derived* label column that a
long-standing project rule had already deprecated as unreliable. The consequence was not a wrong
class — it was that a corroborating witness was found for **0 of 30** functions. Re-keyed on the
address instead of the label, the same join found it for **24 of 30**, every one independently
verified against memory. The defect had survived in a committed producer precisely because its
output was an emptiness, and an emptiness looks like the world rather than like a bug.

Worse, an intermediate finding built on the bad join — a tidy, quotable claim about a standing
backlog item — was entirely an artefact of it, and was caught only because the next step happened to
re-key the same join. **The satisfying lead derived from a suspect instrument is the one to
re-derive first**, because its appeal is exactly what stops you checking it.

Three cheap habits, in order of payoff:

- **Join on identity, not on a label.** An address, an ordinal, a file offset — something the
  program defines. A name or a derived class label is a *display* of identity and can be produced by
  a heuristic somebody deprecated years ago.
- **When a join returns nothing, re-run it with a second key before writing the zero down.** One
  line, and it separates "the evidence is absent" from "my key was wrong".
- **Normalise before joining, and check spelling divergence between artifacts.** Two files in the
  same repo spelled the same table `UNKNOWN_004dda7c` and `UNKNOWN_0x004dda7c`; a naive join reports
  every row as missing, which reads as a finding about the program.

## Delegating a batch to a reader who does not trust your probe is a test of the probe

The largest source of independent scrutiny a producer will ever get is not a review of its code. It
is **handing its output to someone who has to act on it and does not already know what each column
means.**

Measured on one 1999 MSVC/x86 project: six evidence packs, built by one census script, went to six
independent readers with instructions to name the functions in them. Four defects came back and
**all four were in the instruments, not in the readings.**

- **A `vptr_store` column fired on every `MOV [reg], imm32`** — including a body assigning a *string
  pointer* to a field. The program's message pump was reported as installing a vtable, because it
  does `pCrashTracer = "PeekWindows"`. **Three of the six readers refused that citation
  independently**, one observing that a message pump cannot be a constructor. The fix is a property
  of the *target*, not of the store: a vftable's first slot holds a pointer into `.text`; a string's
  first four bytes do not. The column fell 217 → 187, i.e. **14% of it was noise** that had been in
  a committed producer, unremarked, for as long as the column existed.
- **An external callee's address was emitted as if it were citable.** Ghidra puts external functions
  in their own address space, where `getOffset()` returns a small ordinal — so a callee census
  reported `RegCloseKey` as the address `0x00000015`. A reader cited it faithfully; the defect was
  never theirs. **Filter on `isMemoryAddress()` (or `isExternal()`) before emitting any address a
  consumer might use as a key.**

The general shape: **a probe's output is normally read only by its author, who knows what each
column means and unconsciously discounts the cells that look wrong.** A reader who has no such
prior is the cheapest external check the producer will ever get, and the cost is one file.

### The join that is correct only until somebody does the project's work

A calibration arm compared `function.getName()` — unfiltered — against the name its own scanner had
recorded through the **agent-source filter**. Those two agree only while the function is unnamed.
The moment the project named it, they disagreed, and the arm raised claiming the scanner had lost
all five of its hand-verified answers. It had lost none.

The lesson was **already written forty lines further down the same file**, where a different arm in
the same probe says *"MEMBERSHIP BY ADDRESS, never by name — a short name is not an identity"*. That
arm had learned it the hard way. The first one was left keyed on a name because, at the time, the
name was a `FUN_`-style placeholder and therefore *accidentally unique*.

> **A key that is unique only because nothing has been named yet is a time bomb primed by success.**
> When a probe teaches you a lesson, grep the file it lives in before grepping the repo — the same
> author made the same assumption twice within one screen more often than not.

### Apply the anti-circularity guard to the SEARCH, not only to the comparison

A new witness kind guarded every instruction test with a helper that read **both** Ghidra references
and raw operand scalars — precisely because Ghidra does not create a reference for a
`MOV [imm32], reg`. It then *discovered* the candidate bodies to test by calling
`getReferencesTo(...)`, which has exactly that blind spot, and duly reported *"the initializer shape
is gone"* for a five-instruction body sitting in plain sight.

Then, once the search was rebuilt as a program-wide index, it matched only the operand spelling
`dword ptr [0x…]` — while an **absolute** store renders as bare `[0x…]`, which is the form the
target used.

> **Two levels, two chances to be blind.** A correct comparison fed by an incomplete candidate set
> produces a confident zero. Whenever a check filters, ask what *enumerated* the things it filters.

### An argument can name a function that nothing inside it can

A function with **82 call sites**, no import call, no string literal of its own and four anonymous
globals was looked at by three separate rounds and declined each time — there was nothing inside it
to read.

What named it was **what its callers pass in**. At 34 of the 82 sites the caller loads a global that
some initializer filled with `GetId("<some name>")`, and every one of the 26 distinct globals so
reached traced to a developer-written label. The chain — *a caller loads G within the argument
window of the call; some body stores to G and references the string at S; the bytes at S read as a
string* — is three program facts and consults no symbol, so it is checkable forever and cannot be
satisfied by your own markup.

Generalise it: **when a body carries no evidence, look one frame up.** Argument setup is program
fact, and in code that resolves resources by name at start-up it is routinely more self-documenting
than the callee. The same shape appears wherever a program interns strings to ids: resource
managers, event systems, script bindings, message dispatch.

## A pruning sweep is a reachability sweep, and reachability finds load-bearing things nobody can find

Run periodically: **which scripts and artifacts is nothing pointing at?** The framing is "delete the
redundant", and on a healthy project the answer will mostly not be deletions.

Measured on one long-running project — 374 scripts, **6 referenced nowhere outside themselves, and
none of the six was redundant**:

- One **created three functions that a whole-program invariant depends on.** The project's function
  count is checked as `baseline + <enumerated creations>` by every gate it has, and this script
  contributed one of the terms — while appearing in **no** run-order document, gate list or log. It
  read as a dead one-off. It was a step nobody could have replayed.
- One was **the tool to run first after a bad apply** (does the undo stack still reach the last
  checked-in version, or is a snapshot the only route left?) — precisely the thing you cannot afford
  to go looking for during the emergency.
- The remaining four were genuine one-offs of a few kilobytes each, and each was **the evidence
  trail for a recorded finding**. Deleting them saves nothing and costs provenance.

> **A gate checks what it is pointed at.** Nothing in a verification harness can notice a component
> that no list contains — that is the one defect class gates are structurally blind to, and a
> reachability sweep is the only cheap instrument that sees it.

Practical form, and it is a dozen lines: enumerate every script and artifact, concatenate every
document/script/config as a corpus, and report the ones whose name never appears outside their own
file. Then **read each result before deciding anything** — the interesting ones are load-bearing.

### Excusing an artifact repeatedly is a deferral, not a decision

Verification harnesses grow exclusion lists — "this artifact has no producer, skip it". Once an
entry's reason is effectively *nobody maintains this*, the artifact should be **retired, not
excused**. One had been carried under `(none — orphaned)` with an entry saying in as many words that
it was excluded *"because it has no producer, not because it is trusted"*; its row count was one per
pre-merge item against a set that had since been merged.

**An excused artifact is still a FILE**, in the directory everything joins against, and **a stale
artifact that nothing regenerates is worse than an absent one, because it ANSWERS** — plausible rows,
no warning. The exclusion list protects the harness; it does not protect the next author, who will
find the file and use it.

Delete the exclusion entry together with the artifact, and make sure the harness has an arm that
catches an exclusion outliving its file — otherwise the list accumulates ghosts.

### Grade deletion targets by RECOVERABILITY before size

Three targets in one round, three risk classes, and only one needed real ceremony:

| target | recoverable? | what it needs |
|---|---|---|
| a version-controlled artifact | yes, from history | a write-up, no more |
| a scratch directory | *usually* — check, don't assume | verify the claim first (below) |
| ~1 GB of version-control-ignored snapshots | **no** | a stated retention RULE, not a per-file judgement |

For the irreversible one, a rule beats judgement: **keep everything a document names by name, plus a
fixed newest-N window, plus the test fixtures** — mechanical, auditable, and it survives the reviewer
disagreeing with you about any individual file. And check first whether the *primary* recovery path
is something else entirely; here the tool's own version control held every version and the snapshots
were the belt to its braces, which is what made the deletion sane at all.

### "Fully regenerable" is a claim to check, not an adjective to apply

A scratch directory was approved for deletion on that basis and it was **not true**. The mechanical
outputs regenerated from one command. The *delegated readings* did not: their rationale column held
**why a reader believed a conclusion**, and the permanent records kept the conclusion and its
supporting facts but not the reasoning. A judgment cannot be recomputed — which is exactly why its
output has to be **stored** rather than regenerated.

> Before deleting anything called scratch, ask which of its files were produced by a **decision**
> rather than by a script. Those are not scratch, whatever directory they are sitting in.

Keep such records in their **pre-adjudication** form. A quarter of that batch's rows were rejected,
and what a reader got *wrong* is the evidence that priced the filter — the survivors alone cannot
tell you how good the process was.

## A producer written this hour is not safer than one written last year — it is less tested

The instinct is to trust fresh code and audit old code. Invert it. An old producer has survived
every consumer that ever read it; a new one has survived none, and its selftest was written by the
same person, in the same hour, from the same wrong mental model.

Measured: a round built a class-level evidence-pack generator, ran its selftest (10/10, after one
genuine failure it fixed), generated five packs and dispatched five delegated readers. The generator
carried a defect that would have produced **7 confidently wrong names out of 61**. Two independent
readers caught it within the hour. Nothing else was watching, precisely *because* it was new — the
round's attention was on the readers' judgment, not on the instrument that fed them.

- **Treat a new producer's FIRST output as a hypothesis the first consumer is testing**, and say so
  in the brief. Both readers who caught the defect had been told explicitly that defects in our own
  probes were a valuable finding; both delivered one.
- **A passing selftest on a new producer means the author's model is self-consistent**, not that it
  matches the binary. The failing check is worth more than the passing suite: write checks that pin
  a MEASURED value rather than a bound, so that being wrong about the value fires immediately. One
  such check here was written as `< 20`, fired on first run against real data, and the correct
  answer turned out to be 18 — the threshold was wrong, not the artifact.

## No silent caps — a truncated list reads as a measured absence

A harvester that emits `"|".join(items[:8])` is not making a display choice. A consumer that reads
eight strings and a body that references ten cannot tell the difference between *"this body has
eight strings"* and *"someone stopped counting at eight"* — and the first reading is the one every
consumer will make, because a full-looking list is indistinguishable from a complete one.

Measured: a census capped nine separate list columns (`[:8]`, `[:4]`, `[:12]`) with no ellipsis and
no count. A delegated reader working a body that builds a **six**-wide resolution array saw the cell
stop at the fourth entry, and called it *"the finding that would have most changed my reading."*
The reader recovered the rest by hand from the disassembly; one who had not noticed would have
reported a four-resolution screen with full confidence and a clean citation.

- **Emit the horizon: `+N more`.** The cap itself is usually fine and worth keeping — it is the
  silence that is the defect.
- **Sweep the file when you find one.** Caps cluster: they are written in one sitting, in one
  `rows.append([...])`, and fixing one of nine leaves eight producing confident wrong numbers.
- **The same rule applies to an empty block.** When a per-item report has nothing to say about an
  item because the item was never gathered, say *that*, loudly. The same round found evidence packs
  printing a blank citation menu for bodies that already carried a name — because the census
  covering them was scoped to unnamed bodies — and the blank read as *"references nothing."*

### And the cap comes back as a blind spot in the CHECK you write next

Adding `+N more` fixes the *consumer's* reading. It does not fix the next thing anyone writes: a
guard over the emitted artifact. That guard reads the capped cell, so **it judges a sample and
reports a clean zero for anything past the horizon** — the same measured-absence defect the cap
rule exists to prevent, rebuilt one function lower down and now wearing the authority of an
assertion.

Measured, in the same file whose `cap` docstring records the incident above. A new guard asserted
that no emitted citation names a placeholder. Run over the CSV it found **1**; run over the
uncapped in-memory lists the same run found **4**. On a quieter day the emitted-cell version would
have returned zero and been believed.

- **A guard belongs on the widest form of the data the producer holds**, not on the form it prints.
  Accumulate the complete list and assert over that.
- **Keep the emitted-cell arm too**, as the weaker second one: it is the only thing that catches a
  defect introduced at the *formatting* stage, which the uncapped list cannot see.
- **Any count taken from a capped artifact is a FLOOR.** Say so where the number is quoted — one
  round's "146 citations" was measured from the emitted file and inherited by the next round's
  write-up as if it were a census.

## When you fix a join in one checker, grep the file for the same join

The cheapest possible instance of *sweep the pattern, not the instance*, and it was still missed.

A citation checker resolved a class NAME through a hierarchy artifact, which made an entire family
uncitable because none of its 45 tables appears in that artifact. The fix — accept a raw table
ADDRESS as an alternative — was applied to that one checker, with a comment explaining the
reasoning. **Four lines below, in the same file, a second checker did the identical lookup and was
left alone for two rounds.** Measured when a later round tried to use it: **0 of 45** tables
resolvable, and the failure message read *"no vtable for class X"* — which sounds like a fact about
the class rather than a defect in the join.

**Grep for the HELPER, not for the symptom.** `vt_of.get(norm_table(...))` had exactly two call
sites and one of them was fixed. A one-line grep at fix time would have closed both.

## The fresh measurement is not automatically the right one

When a number you just computed disagrees with a committed one, the instinct is to trust yours: it
is visible, it is recent, and its code is in front of you. That instinct is backwards. The committed
producer has survived every consumer that ever read it and carries calibrations you have not
reproduced; your ad-hoc join has neither.

**Measured.** A project had 547 recorded as the size of a residue. An ad-hoc join written to re-check
it said **979** — wrong by 432 in the alarming direction, and enough to have scoped the next round
against a problem 76% larger than the real one. The committed producer attributed each offset to
whichever class **in the inheritance chain** owned it; the ad-hoc join compared against the class's
own fields only, so every inherited field counted as unexplained. The explanation was already in a
comment beside the chain walk.

- **Before believing the disagreement, read what the committed producer DOES THAT YOURS DOES NOT** —
  the specific operation, not "which looks right".
- **An ad-hoc join is a HYPOTHESIS about the committed one, never a check on it.** Use it to locate a
  disagreement; resolve the disagreement by reading, never by preferring the newer number.
- This is the mirror of *a producer written this hour is less tested*: the same asymmetry, pointed at
  a number instead of at a tool.

## Decompose a residue before pricing it

A residue quoted as a single number is not yet a price, and the number is usually inflated by
structure rather than by content.

**Measured**, on the 547 above:

1. **Duplication by design.** Save and Load each contributed a row for the same field, so 547 ROWS
   were **283 distinct `(class, offset)` pairs**. That duplication was the witness's built-in
   cross-check, not noise — halving the number and gaining a check.
2. **Inheritance replication.** Grouping by immediate base, **32 base-class fields explained 445 of
   the 547 (81%)**: one field on a base with 26 subclasses appears 52 times.

Real backlog: **83 decisions with a 32-item head**, against a headline of 547. Always ask of a
residue: *how many DISTINCT facts is this, and how many of them are one fact seen from N places?*

**Group by IMMEDIATE parent, not by root, when one root dominates.** Root grouping put all 283 pairs
in a single bucket because 223 of 224 tables descended from one class. A key whose distribution you
have not checked is not a key — see *check the distribution of whatever you key on before trusting
the key*.

## A built-in cross-check must be MEASURED, not admired

Some witnesses carry their own consistency check: two independently compiled bodies that must agree
(a serializer and its deserializer, a constructor and its destructor, a writer and its reader). That
property is worth a lot and is usually written proudly into the producer's header.

**Measured: it had been described in the header since the day the probe was written, and never once
run.** One join executed it: **19 of 144 classes disagreed** between their save field set and their
load field set — a field written and never read back, or read and never written — and a further
**77 classes had save rows and no load rows at all.** For a project whose stated recovery target was
the save format, those were the highest-value rows in the artifact and nobody had looked.

**A cross-check that is described but never executed is a claim, not a check.** When a producer's
header advertises one, run it in the same round, print the number, and treat any disagreement as
either a probe defect or a genuine asymmetry — both worth a round.

## When a self-checking witness disagrees with itself, price the INSTRUMENT first

Some witnesses come in matched pairs that must agree — a serializer and its deserializer, a
constructor and its destructor, a writer and its reader. Running that comparison is always worth it
(see *a built-in cross-check must be MEASURED, not admired*). What to do with the failures is the
part that goes wrong.

The temptation is to read every disagreement as a finding about the BINARY: a field written and
never read back, an allocation never freed. **Enumerate your own instrument's failure modes first.**
They are a short list, you already know them, and they are far more likely.

**Measured.** A cross-check over 144 classes found **19 disagreements**, recorded as the artifact's
highest-value rows and as candidate format bugs. Reading the bodies: **18 of 19 were the probe's own
limits, and 0 were a genuine write-without-read.**

- **The access is one call deep.** A checked-read helper — `fread(dst,4,1,f)` plus an error bail —
  had **32 call sites**. A scanner that walks each body's own instructions cannot see a read
  performed by a callee, by construction.
- **The value passes through a local.** `tmp = [this+0x1f8] + [this+0x78]; fwrite(&tmp,…)` reads a
  field and writes a stack slot, so the field never appears as a written field. Same for unit
  conversions (`ticks * 1/60`) on the way out and back.
- **A branch is flattened into a set.** A record whose writer branches on a status byte contributes
  the UNION of both arms, which no single reader path will ever match.

All three are one shape: **the field access and the I/O call are not the same instruction.** If your
witness assumes they are, say so in its header, because every disagreement it reports is that
assumption failing before it is anything about the binary.

**And the messiest row can be the only real one.** The single genuine finding in those 19 was the
case that looked most like noise — a discriminated union keyed on an object's status, which a
reimplementation must reproduce. Do not rank rows by tidiness.

## Collapse a population by its shared witness BEFORE investigating any member

A population defined by a negative — *"77 classes have save records and no load records"* — reads as
N investigations and a coverage gap. Check what its members SHARE first; a uniform population is one
question wearing N hats.

**Measured.** Those 77 shared exactly one slot-45 target and one slot-46 target: a single inherited
pair. So it was never 77 questions. And the one question — *why would a base deserializer
legitimately be EMPTY?* — exposed an entire unexamined layer of the file format: the base serializer
writes the object HEADER (type id, handle, parent), and the base deserializer is empty **because the
object cannot read its own type id — you need the id before you have an object to read into.** The
header is consumed by a container above the per-object pair.

- **Group by the witness, not by the members.** One join answered it; 77 readings would not have.
- **An empty inherited method is a design statement, not an omission.** The emptiness names a
  boundary — here, between an object and its container — and points at whatever is on the other side
  of it. That container is where a file format's STRUCTURE lives (framing, null markers, type
  dispatch, pointer fixup), and it is the half that cannot be inferred from field lists.

## A forbidden column does not error — it returns a plausible wrong answer

Projects accumulate columns that are known-bad and marked *do not use*: a deprecated heuristic, a
superseded attribution, a field kept only for history. The prohibition lives in a document; the
column keeps sitting in the CSV, correctly typed and fully populated.

**Measured.** A grouping keyed on such a column returned *"72 of them have no entry"*; keyed on the
correct column the answer was *"all 77 share one entry"*. Nothing failed, nothing warned, and the
wrong answer was the right shape and the right order of magnitude.

- **Cross-check a surprising count against a number the same artifact already prints.** This one was
  caught only because *"72 with no slot-46 target"* contradicted the producer's own headline,
  *"224 tables with a slot-46 target"*, three lines up in its output.
- If a column must not be used, the durable fix is to make reading it loud — drop it from the
  regenerated artifact, or rename it `deprecated_*` so a join on the old name raises a `KeyError`
  instead of quietly succeeding.

## A backlog is made of things already NOTICED — budget "loose ends" as exploration

The finding that reframes a subsystem is structurally not on your open-items list, because every
item on it is something a previous round SAW and deferred. The thing nobody saw is not there.

**Measured.** Four items were logged after a round as tidy-up: two unnamed helpers, an unexplained
constant array, an unidentified predicate. Closing them cost four function bodies and produced the
arc's most consequential fact about the file format under study — one that changed what a
reimplementation would have to do, and that appeared on no list. It was reached only because closing
item 1 required finding a counterpart function, which nobody had opened.

- **Open the NEIGHBOURS of what you are closing**, not just the item. Callers, counterparts, the
  function next to it in the address space.
- **Do not schedule a loose-ends round as a chore and time-box it accordingly.** Its expected value
  is not the items; it is the unlabelled region you have to cross to reach them.

## A defect recorded as a property of one TOOL is a hypothesis about every tool that reads the same kind of thing

A project documented, at length and correctly, that a **printable-run scanner cannot observe where
a string STARTS** — only its NUL terminator is a real boundary — because a preceding float
constant's printable low byte silently prefixes the real name. That defect hid two class names for
**eleven rounds**, and the write-up was thorough: the mechanism, the two names, the bounded-suffix
fix, the cost.

It was filed under the tool that taught it. Nobody asked whether the *disassembler* had the same
blind spot. It does: **71 of 2975 defined strings in the same binary start one or two bytes early**,
absorbing the previous literal's tail, so the code's reference lands strictly INSIDE the datum and
the string reads as *referenced by nothing* — which is precisely the signal a naming round uses to
write a literal off as dead. Same defect, different instrument, one sweep to find, and it sat
unexamined for months beside a document describing it.

**When a round writes up a blind spot, name the CLASS of instrument it applies to, then spend one
probe asking each of the others.** The lesson generalises by *what is being read* (byte runs,
string data, symbol tables, relocation entries), not by which tool happened to expose it. The
question is cheap and the alternative is a correct write-up that protects exactly one code path.

## A guard on the CELL cannot compensate for a wrong POPULATION — and the cell guard is what hides it

A propagator was written to copy a base class's new fields into the descendants that carry a
flattened copy of its layout. Its population rule was *"any struct at least as long as the base
that differs at these offsets"*. That is not "flattened copies of the base"; it is **every class
with bytes at those addresses**. The dry run swept in 19 unrelated classes and 84 cells.

It had a second, correct guard: never overwrite a cell holding a decided name, only a placeholder.
That guard **refused 49 cells in the bad run**, and the refusals were the loudest thing in the
output. Every one of them was true. The run therefore *read as a guard doing its job* — and the
84 cells that sailed through were never printed, because nothing was wrong with them individually.

Two rules come out of this:

- **When a check refuses a lot and the round feels safe, ask what the refusals are a sample OF.**
  A high refusal count over the wrong denominator is evidence of a bad population, not of a good
  guard. Refusal counts are a property of the population you fed in.
- **Put the population rule where it can be tested without the analysis tool running.** Parentage,
  descendant sets, and classification are pure functions over data you already have. Moved into a
  plain-language library with its own poisons, the rule above is one test case — and the test can
  be written from the exact wrong classes the bad run produced, which is a far better fixture than
  anything invented.

## Classify against the state BEFORE the change you are propagating

A repair that copies a base's new members into stale copies has an ordering trap that is invisible
from inside it. Classification asks *"how much of the base does this descendant model?"* — and
adding 7 members to the base takes a descendant from 98-of-102 to 98-of-109, i.e. from
**FLATTENED to PARTIAL**. A rule that classifies against the post-change base therefore
**excludes exactly the classes that need repairing**, and reports a clean population while the
drift it exists to fix sits untouched.

The fix is to exclude the pending change from the denominator: classify against the base's members
*minus the ones being propagated*. It costs one parameter and it is the difference between a
repair that runs and one that silently no-ops.

## An apply whose own writes change what the next census can see should be run to CONVERGENCE

Replacing a 484-byte placeholder with a 4-byte member leaves 480 bytes reverting to single-byte
undefined fillers — and those fillers are *visible to the next pass's query* where the original
blob was not. So a second run of the same applier legitimately finds work the first could not
reach: 44 cells, then 8, then 0.

"Write a multi-step apply to converge rather than assume" is usually read as advice about analyzer
cascades. It applies just as much to an applier whose writes alter the shape its own census reads.
**Run it until it reports zero, and record the per-pass counts** — a single pass that "finished"
is indistinguishable from one that stopped early.

### A read-only round that writes no artifact cannot be distinguished from a round that never ran

**Measured, and it cost a whole round.** A read-only round recovered a type's size and field count
from two return-buffer spans, applied nothing, and wrote no artifact — deliberately and correctly,
because the artifact in question was a *decided* one whose rows require sign-off, not a side effect
of a read. The finding went into the round's notes file and nowhere else.

Seventy-one rounds later, two *other* notes files still asserted the type was unmeasured. A new
round priced itself the way this skill prescribes — **check the committed artifacts before
believing a note** — and the grep returned the type in six artifacts, every hit derived from its
mangled name and none from any layout or size file. That is precisely what *"named by three
manglings and nothing else"* predicts, so the pricing check **agreed with the stale claim** and the
round proceeded to re-derive an answer the project already had.

The stale sentence is not the defect; stale sentences are why the pricing check exists. **The
defect is that the check and the stale claim shared a blind spot**, so running it produced false
confidence rather than no confidence.

- **A read-only finding is only as durable as the cheapest thing that can contradict it.** When a
  round decides not to write an artifact — often the right call — it should record *where the
  finding lives and what would contradict it*, so a later "this is unmeasured" claim is falsifiable
  by searching the notes, not only the artifacts.
- **Give the verdict a name and use it.** If your project already distinguishes *"recorded by
  harvested evidence"* from *"recorded only by our own ledger"*, this is the next rung down —
  **recorded only by prose** — and it is the weakest, because a ledger is machine-readable and a
  paragraph is not.
- **When two records disagree, believe neither until you have opened the body.** Here the two
  loud claims were wrong and the quiet findings file was right. What settled it was reading four
  function bodies. The body-first rule is usually stated as *how you find a layout*; it is also
  **how you adjudicate a project against itself**.
- The round is still worth writing up, **at the original lead's location** rather than as a fresh
  finding — otherwise the next reader sees two independent-looking discoveries of one fact.

### Hand-rolled dataflow over a branching body fails in four ways, and they look like four bugs

**Measured across four iterations of one probe**, each fix revealing the next. The task was
ordinary: work out which of three accumulators feeds each field of a struct written by a large
function with three exit paths. All four failures are the *same* underlying mistake — treating a
branching body as if it ran straight through — and none of them announces itself:

- **Duck-typed operand values.** `getOpObjects` returns `Register` objects, and `Register` has
  `getOffset()`. An extractor accepting anything with `getValue`/`getUnsignedValue`/`getOffset`
  silently reads register encodings as instruction constants. Measured: a block-copy stride came
  out **8** against a true 16, and a store-offset set as `{12, 24}` against `{0,4,8,12}`. Filter
  to the scalar type explicitly.
- **Address order is not execution order.** A linear register-binding walk passes through the
  branch that is the *alternative* to the one that established a binding, and clobbers it — so
  the values read at a store belong to a path that was never taken to reach it.
- **A stack displacement only names a slot at a known stack pointer.** Arguments pushed between
  a value's production and its use shift the frame, so the same textual displacement denotes two
  different slots in one function. Adding frame tracking fixed one path and broke another.
- **Decompiler variable names are reused across exit paths.** A whole-function
  `variable → source` map keeps only the last assignment and silently blends paths.

**Every one was caught by a structural check and none by inspection.** The checks that did it
were cheap and worth copying: *three mechanically different witnesses of the same size must
agree*; *the four fields must divide 1 + 1 + 2 over three categories*; *the separate exit paths
must agree with each other*. Note what those have in common — they constrain the SHAPE of the
answer, independently of the mechanism producing it, so a broken instrument reads as a
contradiction rather than as a surprising result.

The corollary is the reassuring one: **the answer was identical on every run where the
instrument was sound.** When a structural check fires, suspect the instrument first; when it
passes across independent derivations, the result is worth more than any single clean run.

**And the resolution was to stop.** The decompiler already performs this analysis and resolves
all four problems by construction. "Check for a built-in before writing your own" applied from
the first line and was reached only after four iterations — the cost of hand-rolling is rarely
the first version, it is the three that follow.

### A NOT-TAKEN inherited from an older round is a claim, and inherits its staleness

**Measured, and one round after the same project had written up the identical failure.** A round
closed with a NOT-TAKEN copied verbatim from a round 70-odd earlier: *"this needs table X laid
out — still open, and tool Y still not consulted."* Three clauses, all false. The table had been
laid out fifty rounds before; the address quoted as the table's base was a **field inside its
records**; and tool Y described a different structure entirely.

Nothing about the sentence looked stale, because a NOT-TAKEN is written in the present tense and
carries the authority of the round that first recorded it. Copying one forward is the cheapest
possible way to end a write-up and the easiest place for a decayed claim to survive.

- **Re-check each clause of an inherited NOT-TAKEN against the program and the artifacts before
  repeating it** — the same pricing you would do before scoping a round from it, because that is
  exactly what the next reader will use it for.
- **Writing the lesson down does not change the next round's behaviour.** This project had
  documented the identical staleness one round earlier, in the same session. What catches it is a
  *step* in the write-up, not a principle in a file.

### Scope a branch at the next branch, not at a fixed instruction count

**Measured.** A probe needed to know which slot each of three category bits writes to. The body
is three consecutive blocks of the form `TEST reg, <bit>; JZ next; MOV [obj + slot], val`. The
probe looked for the first qualifying store within a fixed window of instructions after each
test — and the window from the second test reached into the *third* block, attributing that
block's store to the second bit. It reported one bit as owning two slots, and the structural
check ("each bit owns a known set") is the only thing that caught it.

A branch ends exactly where the next branch begins. Look for that boundary rather than guessing
a distance: **stop the scan at the next instruction of the same discriminating shape.** Any fixed
window is either too short for one arm or too long for another, and the failure is silent because
a too-long window still finds *a* plausible answer.

Two companions from the same probe, both worth stealing:

- **Expect a SET, not a value, wherever the code may legitimately write more than one slot.** The
  arm category owned two slots (`if (Arm0 == v) Arm0 = v; else Arm1 = v;`). An expectation
  written as a single offset reported a false conflict; written as a set it became a *stronger*
  claim — the bit must reach **both**.
- **Do not extract a scaled-index multiplier by splitting the operand text on `*`.** The scale is
  not among the operand objects, so it must come from the text — but a naive split returns the
  displacement. Anchor a narrow regex on the base you already know: `\*\s*0x([0-9a-f]+)`.

### Build the cheap probe to refute a guess even when you expect it to fail

**Measured, and the refutation was worth more than the guess would have been.** Two adjacent
400-byte blocks in one class, the first already established as an array of 16-byte records. The
obvious hypothesis was that the second was another one. A short probe refuted it in one run —
the region shows a distinct offset at every 4-byte step, i.e. individual fields.

But the probe also printed **which functions touch the region**, and four of them were an
`Add`/`Get`/`Remove`/`Reset` quartet naming the block explicitly. That identified the structure
immediately, and nothing in the project's notes had pointed at it. The round that followed
settled the whole thing on six witnesses.

- **A probe that reports only whether the guess held is worth much less than one that reports
  what it saw.** Print the population, the names, the distribution — the material that lets a
  reader form the *next* hypothesis. The verdict line is the least valuable thing in the output.
- **Function names are evidence.** Where a binary retains them, "who touches this region" is
  often a sharper instrument than any structural inference over the bytes.
- And keep the calibration arm: the same probe's first two versions could not see the *known*
  array either, so a bare "nothing touches +0x1e0" would have been a fact about the probe.

## A bijection closes over the two sides it was given — ask what could be in NEITHER

A join that reconciles perfectly in both directions is the most convincing form a census can take,
and it is a bare count wearing a proof's clothing. `A ∩ B = A = B, zero residue` establishes that
your artifact and your probe agree. It establishes **nothing** about a population outside both.

Measured (1999 MSVC/x86 game, toolbar button descriptors). One round reported
`77 ∩ 77 = 77, zero residue in both directions` between a committed CSV and the call sites of the
constructor that registers those buttons; a later session re-verified it independently; an applier
re-derived it a third time. All three were correct. The conclusion drawn from it — that the button
vocabulary was closed — was wrong: **97** such objects exist. The join compared the artifact against
**the one registrar that had produced the artifact**, and two sibling registrars — *identified by
the same round, in the same findings file* — supply the other 20.

Nothing in the join could have found this. It surfaced only by accident, when applying the recovered
type made an unrelated function legible and that function was seen comparing its argument against
six descriptors that appear in no artifact.

- **Before believing a bijection, name the mechanism that could produce a member of neither set.**
  Here: "is this the only registrar?" — one `getReferencesTo` on each sibling, and the round's own
  notes already listed them.
- **State the DENOMINATOR the join covers, not just the residue.** "77 of 97 descriptors" is the
  honest form; "zero residue in both directions" is true and misleading. This is the
  coverage-as-a-fraction rule from `SKILL.md` applied to joins, and a bijection is the most
  persuasive possible way to state a bare count.
- **A perfect join between an artifact and its own producer is a REPRODUCIBILITY check, not a
  coverage check.** Those are different claims and only one of them is usually the one being made.

## Parse operand OBJECTS, never the rendered instruction text

Two instrument defects in one round, both from reading Ghidra's *printed* form of an instruction
instead of its structured operands, and both producing a confidently absurd number:

- **A `CALL`'s target is not a `Scalar`.** A check that collected `Scalar` operands and looked for
  `fwrite`'s address among them reported **0** calls in a body that plainly makes three. Call
  destinations come from `ins.getFlows()` when `ins.getFlowType().isCall()`.
- **An absolute store is not a member write.** A check that found member offsets by splitting
  `getDefaultOperandRepresentation(0)` on `+` and taking any `0x…` piece read the absolute
  destination `[0x00577190]` as an offset of `+0x577190`, and concluded the object was 5.7 MB. The
  discriminator is structural, not textual: a `[reg + K]` write has a `Register` among its operand
  objects; an absolute one does not.

Related, same round: a body scan bounded at a guessed instruction count (24) cut a 29-instruction
function short and lost its third call. **Bound a body scan at the `RET`** —
`ins.getFlowType().isTerminal()` — not at a number you picked.

The rendered text is a *presentation*: it varies by processor module, by operand-display options,
and by whether a reference has been applied to the operand. `getOpObjects(i)`, `getFlows()`,
`getFlowType()` and `getReferencesFrom()` are the interfaces that mean what they say.

## "Blocked" is a claim about the binary — price it against the binary, not against your notes

A NOT-TAKEN entry that reads *"blocked, the evidence isn't recoverable"* is the entry that stops a
later round from even looking. It is therefore the one that most needs to be right, and it is
routinely the one written with the least work — because concluding that something is impossible
feels like it needs no measurement.

Measured. A round recorded a whole family of five record layouts as un-appliable, correctly
observing that the write-up of the investigation which had recovered them contained corrections but
no layout tables. Two of the five were genuinely gone. The third was not: **two function bodies
between them witnessed all twelve of its fields**, including one — a buffer capacity — that appeared
in no note anywhere. The cost of finding that out was two decompiles; the cost of not finding it out
was a backlog entry telling every future session not to bother.

> **"The evidence is not in the repo" and "the evidence cannot be obtained" are different
> statements.** Writing the first and recording the second is the specific error, and it is easy to
> make because the two produce identical-looking backlog prose.

The rule: **a "blocked" verdict owes one body read** — not a full recovery, just enough to
distinguish *nobody wrote this down* from *this is not in the binary*. This is the read-the-body
rule stated as a negative: read a body before concluding a thing cannot be recovered.

## For interchangeable fields, ask what a PERMUTATION would break

Size checks, bounds checks and tiling checks all validate a layout's SHAPE. None of them can see a
layout whose shape is right and whose field ORDER is wrong — and that failure is available whenever
a struct contains several fields of the same width holding the same kind of thing.

Measured: a 0x24-byte archive record whose five middle fields are all pointers to parsed chunk
buffers. Transposing any two of them yields a struct that tiles perfectly, passes every size and
bounds assertion, decompiles without complaint, and is wrong. Nothing structural distinguishes
them. The only evidence for the order is the code that assigns each one — here, following each
chunk's four-character container id to the field it is stored into.

- **For every group of structurally identical fields, ask what a permutation of them would break.**
  If the answer is "nothing", the layout is under-determined and the ordering check is not
  ceremony — it is the only evidence the order has. Its poison arm should transpose exactly two.
- The same question applies to array-of-struct field plans, to parallel arrays indexed by the same
  key, and to any `{a, b}` pair of the same type where the names are the whole distinction.

## Pair instructions on dataflow, never on proximity

"The next X after Y" is a guess about code layout wearing the clothes of an analysis. It fails
silently the moment anything else emits an X in between, and the failure looks like a finding.

Measured: a check mapping each container chunk id to the struct field it is stored into paired the
tag's `PUSH` with the next member store in address order. Every tag resolved to the same field,
because the constructor ZEROES all five fields immediately after the first tag reference. Arming
instead on the call that actually produces the stored value — the allocator — and taking the store
of *its* result resolved all five correctly.

Related shapes from the same project: scoping a branch at a fixed instruction count runs one
`TEST`/`JZ`/`MOV` block into the next; bounding a body scan at a guessed instruction count truncates
a 29-instruction function at 24 and loses its third call (bound at the `RET`:
`getFlowType().isTerminal()`).

## `this[-1].last_member` is the array cookie, not a use of the last member

A sweep that finds member uses by grepping decompiled C for a placeholder field name
(`this->m_0x2cc`, `this->field_0x54`) will attribute a **false witness to every class's LAST
member**, and it will look like one of the most authoritative witnesses in the harvest.

The mechanism is MSVC's array cookie. A `vector_deleting_dtor` recovers the allocation base as
`(char *)this - 4`, and the decompiler — knowing only the applied struct — spells that as the last
member of the *previous* array element:

```c
dVar1 = this[-1].m_0x3a0;                       /* sizeof(CVehicle) == 0x3a4 */
arena_free((int)&this[-1].m_0x3a0);
return (CVehicle *)&this[-1].m_0x3a0;
```

Nothing here touches `+0x3a0`. `&this[-1].m_0x3a0` is `this - 0x3a4 + 0x3a0`, i.e. `this - 4`.
The same artifact appears with an added constant when the last member is not flush with the end
(`this[-1].m_0x14c + 0x3c`, `sizeof == 0x18c`), and it also turns up in a copy `operator=`
(`param_1 = (T *)((int)&param_1[-1].m_0x3a0 + 3)`).

**Why it is dangerous rather than merely wrong.** The destructor is a body a naming round *wants*
to believe: it is the class's own method, it is short, and a field it touches looks like a real
member with a lifetime. So the false witness lands on the offset with the fewest genuine witnesses
— the tail of the object — and it lands there wearing the strongest-looking evidence in the file.

**The test is textual and cheap: reject any match whose prefix contains a negative index**
(`\[-\d+\]`). **Mark the rows, do not drop them** — a dropped row is invisible and the next reader
re-derives the same false witness; a marked one shows why the count moved.

Measured on one 1999 MSVC/x86 binary, over 1350 member-use rows across four classes: **7 rows, at
exactly 2 offsets, and both were their class's last member.** Small, bounded, and it had already
been reported as a finding by a reader who did not know it was an artifact.

### The same fiction hides an array — and this direction is the expensive one

The array cookie *adds* a false witness. The other rendering artifact *removes* true ones, which is
worse, because a missing witness reads as a measured zero and gets written off.

When a computed address is based on a component, the decompiler renders the access relative to
**that** component with a displacement:

```c
*(HGOBJECT *)(this->m_0x14c + iVar4 * 4 + -0x30) = param_1;   /* SetHomeUnit */
```

That is not a use of `+0x14c`. It is element `iVar4` of an `HGOBJECT[4]` at `+0x11c`
(`0x14c - 0x30`), and the disassembly says so plainly — `MOV [ECX+EDX*0x4+0x118],EAX`. So the
damage runs both ways: the charged component is **inflated** with rows that are not its, and the
array's own offsets read as *"nothing but the constructor touches them"* and are refused under a
zero-init guard.

**Measured on the same corpus: 5 of 1350 rows, 2 offsets, 1 of 4 classes** — and on that project it
was the difference between three refusals and a recovered four-element array plus two more
resolved blocks. A round brief written from the un-resolved index had *predicted* those three
offsets as refusals; a reader who went to the disassembly refuted it.

**Resolve, do not merely flag.** The displacement is a literal in the text, so
`base + disp` is computable and the row can be charged to the offset it actually reaches, with the
original charge recorded. That converts the defect into the instrument's best feature: a text-level
scan that *finds arrays*. A resolved row still earns a disassembly check before it is believed —
the rendering is evidence an array is there, not proof of its extent.

### And an ARRAY-typed component is invisible to a member-token grep entirely

A third shape, found in the same round by a third reader. A component typed as an array is not
assignable in C, so where a copy constructor renders every scalar member as its own token —

```c
this->Render.m_0x34 = param_1->Render.m_0x34;
this->Render.m_0x3c = param_1->Render.m_0x3c;
```

— the array member between them is copied as a block, or not rendered at all. The scan sees the
neighbours and not the field, and the result is the cleanest-looking zero in the harvest: the
offset has *no* row, in a struct where every neighbour has eight.

Measured: one offset, `+0x38` of a 76-byte embedded class, declared `byte[4]`. Its neighbours
`+0x34` and `+0x3c` each had 8 referencing bodies; it had none. The reader who resolved it found it
copied by three copy constructors and read **four times per frame** by the companion DLL, as the
argument of two exported virtuals. It was the round's most-used field and the instrument's flattest
zero.

Note the self-inflicted part: the component was typed as an array **by an earlier round of the same
project**, which declared the 4 bytes it could not attribute rather than dropping them. That was
right. But a defensive type applied to an unknown region then made the region invisible to the next
instrument that went looking — so **check what your own earlier applies did to the shape of the
thing you are now scanning.**

## A setter names a CELL, not a function — and setters write bookkeeping beside the datum

The standard field-naming route pairs an exported accessor with the offset its body writes:
`SetFoo` writes `[this+K]`, therefore `K` is `Foo`. It is one of the highest-yield naming routes
there is, and its failure mode is specific and quiet: **a setter routinely touches more than one
cell**, and the rule charges the noun to whichever one it picked.

**Measured.** Four field names came from four setters on one pass. A later round distrusted all four
and demoted them, on the stated grounds that the bodies were **too short to be a sufficient witness**
— 23, 30, 55 and 134 instructions. Re-examined against the program:

| setter | length | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `SetCommander` | 23 | correct — promoted on a consumer join |
| `SetAlpha` | 30 | **wrong cell** — the value goes elsewhere; the charged cell is a *reference count* the setter increments |
| `SetPosition` | 55 | correct — promoted on two reading bodies |
| `SetTarget` | 134 | **wrong cell** — the target is an inherited member the body also writes; the charged cell is a *one-shot latch* tested and cleared in the prologue |

**The shortest was right and the two longest were wrong**, so the discriminator was not merely weak
— on this population it was anti-correlated, because a longer setter has more cells for the noun to
be charged to the wrong one of.

**The rule.** The question an accessor-derived name has to answer is not *"is this body a big enough
witness"* but ***"does the setter's noun denote the cell the rule charged it to"*** — and that is
answerable only by reading the body. Expect at least these three shapes beside the datum:

- a **counter** the setter increments and a matching `ClearFoo`/`ReleaseFoo` decrements, with the
  resource torn down at zero. Acquire / release / detach-at-zero is a reference count, whatever the
  setter is called;
- a **latch or dirty flag** written on one branch and consumed elsewhere — often in the *prologue* of
  the same function, which makes it look like the function's own subject;
- the **datum's real home in a base class**, already named by an earlier round, with the setter
  writing a derived-class mirror or scratch copy as well.

Two cheap checks that would have caught both errors before either name was applied. **Read the
matched inverse** — `ClearFoo`, `ResetFoo`, `GetFoo` — because a pair discriminates where a single
body does not; `ClearAlpha` was twelve instructions and settled the question outright. And **look
for an already-decided cell that the noun fits better**: `Target` was applied to a class that already
carried a decided `TargetHandle` at an inherited offset, so the emitted struct ended up with two
targets. A naming route should refuse, or at least flag, a noun that duplicates a decided member of
the same object.

**Corollary for the demotion tier.** If your project has a tier meaning *"applied, but the evidence
was judged insufficient"*, note what it does and does not protect. It protects the name from being
destroyed by a rebuild. It does **not** stop the name reaching an emitted header, a struct, or a
reader — so a name later measured to be on the *wrong cell* is a defect with a mutating fix, not a
row that can be left sitting in the demoted tier.


## A witness kind can be UNANSWERABLE, and a null then means the opposite of what it reads

`confidence=none` reads as *"nobody has looked yet"*. It can also mean *"this instrument cannot look
here"*, and the two are indistinguishable in the artifact. Measured: a round inherited the question
*"does this function's body use register ECX as an object pointer?"* from the previous round's own
abstention text. Every one of its 27 subjects turned out to be a **one- or two-instruction stub** that
touches ECX not at all. The question is not unanswered for them — it is **unanswerable**, because
there is no instruction to read. A producer built on the inherited framing would have returned 27
honest nulls, and every later round would have read them as an unworked backlog.

**Check that the question is answerable where you intend to point the instrument, before building
it.** Four function bodies opened by hand settled this in minutes, before any producer existed. This
is why *read the body first* is a rule and not a preference.

**When the subject cannot testify, look for a witness about its CALLERS or its CONTEXT.** For a
virtual function the dispatch site binds every implementation of that slot: if any *other*
implementation of the same slot demonstrably uses the register as an object, the call site must load
it, and every override reachable there receives it — including a stub that ignores it. The evidence
is about the call, not the callee, which is exactly why it works where the body does not.

**Corroborate a structural grouping you invented with a byte-level invariant it predicts.** That slot
witness depends on a guess about which vtables belong to one class family (agreement on a fraction of
common slots). The callee-cleanup byte count in each `RET` is an independent prediction of that
grouping — every implementation of one slot *must* pop the same number, because the caller pushes one
argument list and cannot know which override it reaches. Where the group agreed, the grouping was
corroborated from the bytes; where it disagreed, the row abstained. **Do not report the witness and
the grouping as one number.**

## Design a census artifact to SURVIVE the apply it justifies

A census keyed on *"the population still needing work"* deletes itself as the work is done. Measured:
an artifact keyed on the residual blind bucket would have shrunk from 34 rows to 11 the moment its
apply landed — **discarding the recorded witness for every function it had just justified**, leaving
the round's central claim provable only from a commit message.

Key it on **the residual population UNION the round's own ledger**. The ledger supplies *addresses
only*; every witness column is still measured from the program, so this is not reading your own
conclusions back as evidence. Add a verdict value for *already applied*, and a check that **refuses if
a ledgered row would no longer qualify under today's rules** — otherwise the applied rows become a
free pass and a later change to the rule silently exempts exactly the population it should re-grade.

The measurable payoff: across the apply, **every byte-derived count held identically** and only the
verdict census moved. **An artifact whose numbers survive its own apply is a regression detector; one
that must be re-pinned every round is a snapshot.**
## Match the SCOPE of a measure to the scope of the question

A similarity measure over a whole structure is the wrong instrument for a question about one element
of it, and the failure is quiet because the number looks reasonable.

Measured, on vtables. The question was *"do these two classes mean the same method at slot N?"*; the
rule answered *"do their tables agree on ≥50% of all common slots?"*. That statistic is dominated by
the shared **base prefix** — every class in a hierarchy copies its base's entries — so it stays high
for two classes that diverged long before slot N. A 223-slot table was grouped with five 184-slot
ones at 51–53% agreement that agree with it on **0%** of the slots near the slot in question. Their
slot N held a different method, and the callee-cleanup byte counts proved it.

**And the obvious fix failed in the opposite direction, which is why it needs its own failure
analysis.** Narrowing the same measure to the element's neighbourhood is too STRICT wherever the
derived structure legitimately differs most: a class that overrides many neighbouring methods has
*low* local agreement with its own base **precisely because it is derived**. Two genuinely related
classes differed at 22 of 41 low slots. Swept over 20 (window, threshold) settings, the local rule
condemned the same row at **every one** — unanimity that read as a robust finding and was an artefact
of the flaw every setting shared.

**A fix to a heuristic is a new heuristic.** "It disagrees at every setting" is not robustness when
all the settings share one defect.

### Prefer recovered structure to a structural heuristic — and check whether you already have it

The sound test needed no threshold at all:

> element N means the same thing for two types iff N lies within the *declaring* ancestor — the
> nearest common ancestor whose own structure is large enough to contain it.

That is recovered **parentage** plus sizes, both of which the project had already committed months
earlier and neither of which the round used. It validates by inspection: a slot declared in the
38-entry root admits every one of its 38 descendants; a slot declared in the 47-entry intermediate
admits 67; a deep slot narrows to 1.

**Before inventing a structural heuristic, grep the evidence directory for an artifact that answers
the question directly.** The heuristic is the thing you build when the answer genuinely is not
recoverable — not the thing you build first.

**Report the recovered instrument's own coverage gap rather than absorbing it.** The hierarchy
mapped 244 of 296 tables; a subject in one of the other 52 gets an explicit `untestable` verdict
naming the gap, never a silent pass or a silent failure. Those two mean opposite things and a single
"no evidence" value hides which one you have.

### A shared NAME is not a parentage

The intuition that flagged the local rule as wrong was *"these two classes are obviously related,
look at their names"*. Their chains met only four and five links up. The intuition reached the right
conclusion by the wrong route, which is the hardest kind to catch: the slot was shared because it sat
inside the ROOT's table, and the shared prefix in the names was irrelevant. **When a naming intuition
contradicts a measurement, resolve it against the hierarchy artifact — do not let either win on
plausibility.**

### A trap fixed in one derivation is waiting in its siblings — audit a metric per column, not per tool

A project that reduces its progress to a handful of computed denominators has built something worth
auditing one column at a time, because each column is its own derivation and each can mean something
other than its definition. Measured on one project with four: the **fourth** column audited was the
fourth to fail, and it failed in the way the tool's own docstring had documented for the second.

- The tool said, of the size column, *"sizes live in FOUR producers and no single file is
  authoritative; a check reading one reports 280 unsized where the truth is 55"* — and poison-tested
  it. Three functions down, the layout column read **one** artifact of four and reported **12** where
  the truth was **205**. Nothing looked wrong: 12 is a plausible number, its rule was printed beside
  it, and a 282-class wave had been planned against it. **When a defect is documented for one
  derivation, grep the tool's own source for sibling derivations with the same shape** before
  believing any of them.
- **A metric's supporting sentence is a population claim, and one join checks it.** The plan said
  *"41 of the 55 are unnamed vftables; they need naming before they can be sized."* The tool's own
  join said 40; naming is not a prerequisite for sizing (the witness is an allocation); and 39 of the
  40 already carried an exact allocation size in a committed artifact the size deciders never read.
  The sentence stood a day; the check took a minute.
- **A boolean presence metric hits its target with one row per entity.** "Classes with a layout"
  needed two companions to mean anything: the entities laid out *by construction* (101 classes that
  add no storage to their base — a target of "every class" that counts them as missing can never be
  reached), and **coverage** — bytes of own storage under a field row, 56.6% there against "205 of
  294 present". Report presence and coverage apart; the second is what a wave plans against.
- **Keep the old rule reachable as the negative twin.** The legacy derivation stayed callable and
  became a fixture arm: the new rule must see what the old one could not, on a fixture where the old
  one demonstrably fails. That is the two-step diff for a definition change, and it is what makes
  "12 → 205" a repair rather than a relabel.

## Frequency over a corpus counts COPIES, and a corpus of assets is full of them

Ranking a work queue by how often something occurs across the shipped data is the obvious
prioritisation, and it is right often enough to be trusted without checking. The failure is specific:
**a histogram over a corpus measures occurrences, and content is duplicated between corpus members
far more often than code is.**

*Observed in the third-party project `gmegidish/crux-re-claude`, whose `tools/opcode_usage.py`
carries the warning in its own docstring.* It histograms script opcodes across all 29 of the game's
scenes to rank which unimplemented ones the port should do next — and notes that a high count can
mean **duplicated debug code**: a give-all-items program written once and copied into every scene
inflates one opcode to 29 occurrences with a single author decision behind it.

The general shape, and it applies to any per-asset sweep, not just scripts:

- **A count over a corpus is `occurrences`; what you usually want is `distinct members that need
  it`.** Report both. `29 occurrences / 1 distinct origin` and `29 occurrences / 29 members` are the
  same number ranking opposite work, and only the second is a queue.
- **Duplication in a corpus is the norm, not a defect to fix.** Templates, per-level copies of a
  shared prologue, boilerplate emitted by a tool, and debug scaffolding left in every map all
  multiply one decision into N rows. This is the same instinct as the rule that coverage is stated
  as a **fraction of the population it claims to cover**, one level down: a bare count hides whether
  the denominator is authors or artifacts.
- **The cheap check is a hash, not an analysis.** Before believing a frequency ranking, group the
  containing records by content hash and see how much of the top of the histogram collapses. If it
  does, the ranking was measuring your corpus's copy-paste history.


## An index nothing populated answers like a measurement

A query tool over a derived index has two failure states that look identical to the caller and
neither is an error: the index is **absent** (the export did not finish) and the index is **empty**
(it finished and wrote nothing). Both must **refuse**, with different messages — collapsing them
tells the reader to re-export when the export is fine, or the reverse.

**Measured.** An offline corpus wrote two of its program-wide indexes as empty lists, under a
comment explaining that *a bounded trial* writes them empty. There was no trial branch, so the full
export did it too — for as long as the corpus had existed. The two commands built on those indexes
then printed nothing (exit 0) and `no recorded writer for <addr>` (exit 0), for a string with three
real referrers and a global with five real writers. Three of the seven evidence kinds the whole
delegation pipeline runs on were silently unserviceable, and any agent told "query the corpus
first" would have recorded absences that are not there.

> **A comment describing a branch is not a branch.** Grade the branch: if a conditional matters,
> there is a run of the tool in each arm that proves it.

**The independence of a second derivation is what makes this findable.** The same facts existed in a
committed artifact built by a different script for a different purpose. Deriving the index *from the
program* rather than from that artifact kept the two independent — and cross-checking them caught
**two** defects in the repair itself: a raw newline written unquoted (splitting one row into two,
one parsing with a punctuation mark as its address), and a collector that kept only code referrers
while its own docstring claimed the rest were counted. The tidier design — have the index read the
artifact — would have made them agree by construction and shipped both.

**Report the residue as a named column, not as a count.** After the repairs the two derivations
still differed on 71 of 2,972 rows. Every one of the 71 had a non-zero `true_offset` and an
`interior` reference shape in the artifact, and the raw value matched the artifact's *uncorrected*
column in 71 of 71 — one correction layer, fully explaining both the text and the referrer
differences. *"They differ on 71 values"* is a worry; *"they differ exactly where this column says
they should"* is a closed finding.

**And give an expensive producer a cheap re-run for the part that is cheap.** These indexes depend
on references and memory, not on the decompiler, but repairing them was costing a full 25-minute
re-export. A mode that rebuilds only them — refusing unless the on-disk export matches the live
program version, so it can never patch a stale cache into looking current — took 80 seconds, and
that is the difference between fixing both defects and recording one as a known issue.


## `git show` is not a byte comparison, and reaching for the local hazard to explain it is its own trap

Comparing a regenerated artifact against the committed one is the core move of any
regression check on a harvester. `git show HEAD:path` looks like the way to get the committed
bytes. It is not: it prints the **normalised blob**, after whatever clean filters and CRLF
conversion the repo is configured for.

Measured: a 5630-row CSV written by Windows-hosted Ghidra read **505179** bytes in the working
tree and **499548** from `git show`. That is a 5631-byte gap — one CR per line, header included —
and it looks exactly like a real content change on a file that had not changed at all.

**Compare with `git rev-parse HEAD:<path>` against `git hash-object <path>`.** Both apply the
same clean filter, so they agree exactly when the content agrees; both emit a single value, which
is the shape least likely to be mangled by whatever sits between you and the terminal.

The second half of this is the reasoning failure, and it is the more expensive one. The project
where this happened has a documented, real hazard in its own toolchain — an output-filtering
proxy that genuinely does rewrite some commands' output — and the first explanation reached for
was *"the proxy truncated it"*. Plausible, locally famous, and wrong. **A known hazard is a
hypothesis, not an explanation**, and a known hazard that would explain the anomaly is exactly
when to test rather than conclude: the test here was one command (`/usr/bin/git` directly, then
the byte arithmetic) and it took under a minute. Writing down a plausible mechanism as though it
were measured is how a project acquires a confident wrong answer that nothing later re-examines —
the anomaly is "explained", so nobody looks again.

## A backlog item is a claim; re-derive it when you pick it up, not when you doubt it

`SKILL.md`'s round zero says to keep *measured-zero* distinct from *not-yet-run*, because a
stale "unknown" reads as an opportunity forever. Here is that failure at project scale, and
the two habits that would have prevented it.

Measured on a 1999 MSVC/x86 binary. A backlog carried, across three session handoffs and two
notes files, *"a mangled-name string table at ~`0x005003xx` — a THIRD place the binary spells
class names, and nobody has looked at what it does cover"*, ranked as the highest-certainty
open naming source. It is not a third place. It is the **PE export directory's own name-string
pool** — the same names, seen as strings instead of as export records. Read by address range:
**977 strings, 977 already in the project's own exports artifact, 0 new.** The mechanism was
confirmed rather than assumed: each string carries exactly one data reference, from a
contiguous array of RVAs, with the strings in alphabetical order — the shape of the export
directory's `AddressOfNames` table.

Two things make this worth a rule rather than a shrug:

- **The refutation was already in the repo.** Another notes file recorded *"1970 export rows
  over 986 addresses; 976 addresses exported twice (mangled + undecorated)"*, and a third
  exploited that twin as a free demangler cross-check. The knowledge was present; the lead was
  written as though it were not. **Two prose files disagreeing is invisible** — nothing joins
  prose to prose, so a stale claim and its refutation can sit in the same tree for months.
- **Nobody had priced it, because inheriting it felt like knowing it.** The check cost one
  query against a file already committed. What kept it alive was that each session received it
  as a *stated fact* in a handoff and scheduled it rather than testing it.

**So: write the PREDICTED YIELD into the backlog item.** "Unswept source X" is not a task, it
is a noun; "unswept source X, expected to name ~N functions the export table does not" is a
task whose premise can be graded the moment someone picks it up — and would have been graded
false here in one step. Then, when you do pick it up, **re-derive the premise before scoping
the work**, not because you doubt it but because it is a claim and its age is not evidence.

## When a population has a POSITIONAL definition, do not select it with a PATTERN

Same round, and the instrument defect it walked into is worth its own line, because the
correct fix is not "write a better pattern".

The first two passes selected mangled names with a recalled regex,
`^\?[\w?$]+@[\w@?$]*@@[A-Z_0-9]`. It matched `??0AIPlayer@@QAE@ABV0@@Z` and **rejected**
`??0AIPlayer@@IAE@XZ` — identical prefixes, differing only in the signature tail. The match on
the first succeeded by backtracking so that `[\w@?$]*` swallowed `@QAE@ABV0` and the `@@` then
matched deep inside the *signature*, not the scope terminator. The regex was not measuring the
property it was named for at all. It reported 906 members of a 977-member population and
manufactured an unexplained 793-item gap that cost two further measurements to chase down.

The population had a positional definition all along — a contiguous address range — and
selecting by range removes the instrument from the answer entirely. A pattern is a *hypothesis
about the data*; it needs its own evidence before it can be used to gather evidence. Prefer,
in order: an address range or a table's own bounds; a set intersection against a committed
artifact; a census of the actual token vocabulary in the population; and only then a pattern.

## A queued item's stated BLOCKER is an untested premise too

A backlog item is a claim, and the claim that decays quietest is not *"this fact is still true"* —
it is ***"this is still what the item is waiting for."*** The item's facts get re-derived when
someone finally works it; its stated blocker gets copied forward verbatim, because it reads as
scoping rather than as a finding.

Measured. An item asking whether a function's first parameter, typed as an ancestor of the owning
class, should be narrowed to the owner had been queued for eight rounds and restated in three
handoffs as needing a specific new capability — offset-aware tracking of *call receivers*. It never
needed it. The question is about member **accesses**, not call **receivers**, and the witness for
it — how far any access through `this` reaches, compared with the declared type's known size — had
been produced by the existing scanner for over a hundred rounds. One probe over the whole
population: 79% of the rows met the condition immediately.

Two things follow, and the second is why this is cheap enough to be a rule:

- **When you pick up a queued item, re-derive the blocker before you build for it.** The item's
  author knew less than the project knows now, and nothing re-checks that sentence.
- **Testing a blocker is cheaper than testing a fact**, because it is a question about tools you
  already have rather than about the target. It is usually one probe over the item's own
  population, and it either closes the item or tells you the blocker is real.

The corollary for writing items: **say what the item needs in terms of the OBSERVATION, not the
mechanism.** "Needs a witness that the body touches bytes the declared type does not have" survives
contact with a changing toolbox; "needs offset-aware alias tracking" was wrong the day it was
written and read as authoritative for eight rounds.

## In a topological population, "contributes nothing" is not "can be skipped"

When a population is computed by fixpoint — build what you can, then build what that unblocked,
repeat — every node has two roles: what it contributes, and what it unblocks. A filter written
against the first quietly destroys the second.

Measured. A wave built structs for classes whose base was already built. The rule skipped any
class with a decided size, a built base and no recovered fields of its own, reasoning correctly
that it contributes zero components. That kept it out of the `built` set, so **every class derived
from it was refused for a base that could have been built** — one 184-byte class took its only
descendant down with it, and the wave reported a single pass where there were two.

The tell is that the skipped node looks *obviously* pointless in isolation, which is exactly why
nobody re-examines it. The fix was to build it with its own region left undefined: an undefined
region claims nothing, the inherited prefix is real, and the node stops being a hole in the graph.

**Before skipping a node for having no payload, ask what depends on it.** In a flat population
this costs nothing; in a topological one it silently truncates the result, and the missing items
are refused with a plausible-looking reason rather than being visibly absent.

## When a prerequisite turns out to be unobtainable, re-derive what the GOAL needed

A blocked task usually carries a stated prerequisite, and the prerequisite is usually a property
of the *method someone first imagined*, not of the goal. When it turns out to be unobtainable, the
reflex is to abandon the task or to go hunting for a stronger witness. Check first whether the
goal ever depended on it.

Measured, twice in four rounds on the same project. A struct-building wave was blocked on the size
of three base classes; investigation established those sizes are **genuinely unrecoverable** — a
base never allocated on its own only ever has `sizeof(derived)` materialised by the compiler, and
nothing observable lies inside the remaining window. The wave landed anyway, because the structs
are **flattened at absolute offsets**: a field at offset X sits at X whichever class owns it, so
the undecided base boundary changes *attribution*, not *layout*. Flattening from the nearest
ancestor that IS decided, and leaving the region above it undefined, asserted strictly less and
delivered the whole payoff. Separately, a signature-narrowing item had been queued for eight
rounds behind "needs offset-aware alias tracking"; the witness it actually needed had existed for
a hundred rounds and closed 79% of the population in one probe.

**The question to ask is not "how do I obtain the prerequisite" but "what does the deliverable
actually consume".** Those differ whenever the prerequisite was written down by someone sketching
one route.

The corollary for writing the item down in the first place: **state what the goal needs in terms
of the OBSERVATION, not the mechanism.** "Needs a prefix to flatten" survives contact with a
changing toolbox; "needs sizeof(immediate_base)" sends the next reader after a number nobody can
measure.

## A lookup that can answer "no" for a STRUCTURAL reason is a false zero waiting to happen

Type systems in reverse-engineering tools are namespaced, and the namespace is usually invisible in
the question you think you are asking. "Does this class have a struct?" looks like a yes/no about
the program. Implemented as a lookup in **one** category, it is a yes/no about *where the struct
happened to be created*.

Measured. A sweep asked for a type at the root category path. Structs the project itself builds
land there — so the lookup found every one of its own and looked healthy. Structs the tool's own
**demangler** builds land under a different category, and for those the answer was always "no". A
real 1124-byte structure, matching the class's independently decided size exactly, was reported as
absent, and 25 rows of a live population were refused for a reason that was not true.

Three things generalise beyond category paths:

- **Ask what a `no` could mean other than "absent".** A namespace not searched, a spelling not
  normalised, a population filtered before the join — each turns a lookup into a partial one whose
  negative answers are indistinguishable from real ones.
- **Assert the lookup finds SOMETHING.** A resolver that answers `no` for every row in a population
  whose members all satisfy a related, independently-established property (here: every owner had a
  decided size) is the instrument failing, not a finding. Key it on emptiness, not a threshold.
- **The direction of a partial lookup decides its severity.** A false `no` that only ever REFUSES
  is conservative — it withholds work and never corrupts it. A false `no` that admits, or that
  feeds a count someone quotes, is not. Say which yours is, because it is the difference between a
  round that lost 25 rows and a round that published a wrong number.

## The witness a round needs is often already in the scan output it is discarding

Before building a new instrument for a question, read the full return value of the one you are
already calling.

Measured. A round classified bodies by whether any class's vtable pointed at them, and the ones in
no vtable were written up — in the round record, the commit message and the applier's header — as
resting on the analyst's own attribution with nothing external corroborating them. That claim was
testable and wrong for most of the population. **39 of those 49 bodies were constructors and
destructors, which is precisely WHY no vtable slot points at them** — and a constructor *stores its
own class's vtable pointer through `this`*. The body-scanning helper had been returning exactly
that, in a field beside the one the sweep was reading, for dozens of rounds.

The general form: a scan that walks a body usually collects several facts at once (writes, reads,
calls, stores of known constants). A round asks for one of them and looks past the rest. **When a
round concludes "there is no independent witness here", grep the scanner's return keys before
believing it.**

Two riders. Report such a witness as a **floor, not coverage** — a non-constructor has no reason to
store a vtable, so a miss says nothing either way. And if the check arrives *after* the decision it
would have informed, **record that order**: a round that turns out well-evidenced in hindsight is
not the same as one that was well-evidenced when it acted, and the difference is exactly what a
later reader needs to calibrate the next approval.

## An OVERLAP is not a YIELD: pricing a round from a join instead of from the witness

The cheapest-looking way to price a round is a join between two committed artifacts: *"N classes
carrying M unknown bytes were also touched by the thing we just did — so M bytes are addressable."*
That number is an **overlap**, and an overlap is an upper bound with no lower bound attached.

Measured. A layout gap of 8,767 bytes over 75 classes was joined against the 23 classes a previous
round had just re-typed: 4,154 bytes, 47% — and that figure went into the recommendation. Actually
pointing the witness at those bodies covered **592 of 5,534 bytes (10.7%)**, and the single largest
target — a 784-byte span the round was scoped around — stayed **744/784 dark**, with half the
supposedly-relevant bodies touching *nothing* inside it.

The join was correct. It answered "do these populations intersect?" and was read as "how much would
the second recover from the first?" Those differ by however sparse the witness turns out to be, and
sparsity is exactly what you cannot see from the join.

- **Price with the instrument you would actually run**, over a sample if not the whole population.
  A probe that takes seconds beats a join that takes none.
- **Report the population size that feeds the witness**, not just the target size. In the case
  above, the classes scoring 0.0% had *one* method filed under them — the witness was under-fed,
  not weak, and the per-class method count made that visible at a glance where the percentage alone
  did not.
- **Put the price in the message that proposes the round.** A refutation costs nothing when it
  arrives before the work; it costs a decision when it arrives after someone has approved.

## A cross-check that cannot distinguish the subject is NO result, not a weak one

When a measurement comes back suggestive but the instrument cannot separate your subject from
something else, the honest report is "unusable", not a hedged number.

Measured. To test whether a 744-byte region of one class was touched anywhere, every function's
disassembly was searched for a memory displacement inside that byte range. It returned 57
functions — which looked like a promising lead until they were read: almost all belonged to a
*different, larger class* accessing its own objects at the same numeric offsets. A raw displacement
carries no type, so `+0xc6c` on one object is indistinguishable from `+0xc6c` on another.

The temptation is to report "57 functions, though some may be unrelated". Don't. **A number that
answers a different question is precisely the kind that gets quoted later as though it answered
this one** — the stale-denominator failure, seeded deliberately. Say the instrument cannot
distinguish the subject, give the reason, and report no count at all.

## A bucket label is a claim, and it is the one the reader acts on

Deriving a breakdown's counts and then hand-writing its category labels leaves the analysis half
done. Nobody scopes work from a bare number: they read the label, and the label is where an
unbacked claim about *cost* slips in beside a number that is genuinely measured.

Measured. A round replaced a stale hard-coded breakdown with a derived one — good — and labelled two
of its four buckets *"mechanical, named by contract"* and *"mechanical, named from its slot"*. Both
asserted a cheap naming route. Both routes had already been priced and refuted by that same
project: one of them by a probe whose header is literally titled *"Is this naming route real?"*,
which had found the rule structurally broken (a derived class's dispatch table is laid out as
`[base's slots][the derived class's own new virtuals]`, so sibling branches assign the same index to
unrelated methods **by construction**). The corrected form of that route had yielded **6** names
against a bucket the label called mechanical at **376**.

Three rules:

- **A count needs a derivation; a label needs a citation.** If a label implies work is cheap, name
  the measurement that says so. If no measurement exists, the label describes *what the rows are*,
  not *what they will cost*.
- **Before writing "mechanical", grep for the probe that priced it.** A project that prices routes
  tends to name those artifacts predictably (`diag_price_*`, `*_candidates.csv`); the refutation is
  usually one search away and a hundred sections old.
- **Prefer structural labels.** "In the static-initializer table" and "reached from a dispatch
  table" are facts that stay true. "Mechanical" is a forecast, and a forecast belongs in a round's
  pricing, not in a standing report.

The residue is worth stating positively: after the correction, the breakdown said three *kinds* of
function with **no cheap route known for any of them**. That is a more useful thing to hand the
next round than a false cheap/expensive split, because it changes the plan from "do the easy
half" to "this is body-read work or it is nothing".

## A secondary verdict on an excluded row reads as a lead

An evidence artifact that records two instruments side by side will be read one column at a time.
If the second instrument's verdict is populated on rows the first has already excluded, the verdict
column becomes a false lead for anyone who reaches it before the exclusion — and a citation that
quotes only the second instrument's counts guarantees they will.

Measured. A candidate census carried a structural test (*is this dispatch-table slot comparable
between these two classes at all?*) and, beside it, an independent body-side test (*do the two
bodies pop the same number of argument bytes?*). Every row failed the structural test and said so in
an `exclusion` column. The body-side column still read `agrees` on 27 of them — trivially, since
most bodies took no arguments. A report cited the file as "72 rows, 42 CONTRADICTS", and the next
session's handoff turned that into "27 agree, 6 were applied, 21 are waiting": the 6 had been
applied by a *different rule from a different population*, and a join by address showed the two
shared no row. The lead cost a round to refute and had never existed.

Three rules:

- **A subtraction across two artifacts is a join, not arithmetic.** Before "N candidates minus M
  applied", join by identity and count the intersection. If it is empty, so is the lead.
- **Render a secondary verdict conditional on the primary.** `agrees` on an excluded row is a
  coincidence; print it as one (*"27 carry an arity that agrees BY COINCIDENCE on a non-comparable
  row"*), and print a row that passes the primary test — should one ever appear — as a live lead
  rather than folding it into an aggregate.
- **Cite the column that closes the question, not the one that opens it.** Quoting the count of
  outright contradictions implies the remainder is open. Quote the exclusion count, or derive both
  in the report so the sentence beside them cannot drift.

The companion trap, from the same round: **the throwaway census is where a forbidden join key gets
used.** A column a project has banned from its *checks* was used in a "just pricing" join and
produced a clean-looking zero from a dead key — 149 of 149 shared bodies with no owner. Run the
positive control (the names the rule already applied must re-derive) before believing any zero, and
exclude pairs that agree by construction (a non-overriding subclass points at the *same* body as its
base) before quoting a calibration; the trivial pairs inflated one here by a factor of five.

### An address→function map built on STARTS alone never answers "no function"

A tool that resolves an address by bisecting over function start addresses returns the
nearest preceding start for every address — including addresses past the end of that
function, in padding, or at an undiscovered entry point — and calls the result the container.
It cannot say "no function" because it has no extents to say it with. Measured twice on one
project: an undiscovered entry point reported as `FUN_0048faa0 +0x90` (the neighbour ended
at `0x0048fb25`), and later a nine-row census of vtable slot targets recorded as "inside
another function's extent" when the program held every one inside NO function
(`getFunctionContaining == None`). The first was written up as a caveat; the second round
read the caveat inverted — *"ask the tool which function contains it"* — and the census
built on it stood until an applier re-derived the population from the program and got an
empty set. A prose caveat protected nobody; the repair was in the tool: containment now
comes from an extents source (an exported per-function size), an address past the end
answers `-` and names the function that ends before it, and the start-only bisect survives
only behind a flag whose output column is labelled `preceding`. **Anything that answers
"which function is this address in" must carry extents or say that it does not.** The exact
answer is always the program's `getFunctionContaining`, and a census that decides a
mutation's MECHANISM should ask the program, not a symbols file.


## When an instrument under-reports, print its INTERMEDIATE state, not its verdict

A measured quantity disagreed with what the disassembly plainly showed: a constructor's write
extent came back short, twice, on two unrelated bodies. Two plausible causes were written down
and both were refuted by reading the code rather than by running it — the alias tracker does not
drop the object pointer at a call (it drops only the caller-saved registers, and says so), and it
does not walk through a branch it never took (that defect existed and had been repaired).

Writing the refutations down is what made the next step a probe with a specific question instead
of a third guess. The probe printed the tracker's resolution **beside every candidate store**, and
the answer was immediate and was in neither suspected component: the tracker resolved the object
pointer correctly at every single missing store. The consumer was discarding its answer — on a
call to a recognised allocator it REPLACED the tracker with a fresh one seeded on the return
value, which is right when a factory allocates the object it is building and wrong when a
constructor allocates a sub-object while its own `this` is still live in a callee-saved register.

Had the probe printed only the final number, the natural reading would have been "the tracker is
broken", and the next round would have gone and repaired a component that was correct.

**The gap between an instrument's intermediate state and its verdict is the whole finding.** Print
the intermediate state. And when an explanation is refuted, write the refutation down — it is what
stops the round proposing a fourth cause with the same confidence as the first three.

Two further rules the same case makes concrete:

- **A LOWER bound that under-reports is sound and still expensive**, and that is why it survives.
  Nothing decided from it is wrong, no gate can fire on it, no artifact contradicts anything —
  the cost is entirely in decisions that were never made. Defects that preserve soundness do not
  announce themselves; they are found by noticing a number disagrees with the bytes and refusing
  to move on.
- **The output such a finding owes is a DENOMINATOR, not a repair.** Where the instrument is
  shared — here, a scanner consumed by nine sweeps and three appliers — the fix is its own round
  with a full before/after diff over every artifact those producers write. What the discovering
  round owes instead is the exposed population (16 of 37 bodies, 1 to 23 lost stores each) and a
  committed reproducer that grades itself, so the round that does the repair starts with the
  measurement made and knows when it is finished.

## A forward instruction walk seeded from an ADDRESS must know where the function ends

A rule scanned forward a fixed number of instructions from a load to decide whether the loaded
value was used as an address. It had no notion of a function boundary, so on the shape
`MOV ECX,[ECX+K]; MOV [EAX],ECX; RET 4` — an out-parameter getter, where the useful instructions
run out at the third — the walk stepped over the `RET` and read the NEXT function's instructions
as evidence about this one. One committed row got a confident pointer type from a body it had
never heard of.

The distinction that makes this cheap to audit: **a walk over a function's address set is bounded
by construction; a walk seeded from a single address is not.** Censusing one project's scanners on
that basis, 31 of 36 passed an address set and were safe without anyone having thought about it,
four were deliberate whole-section walks, and the one remaining was the defect.

Stop such a walk at a non-fall-through instruction, and — where the seed sits inside a defined
function — at any instruction outside that function's body. The two catch different cases: the
first still holds where no function is defined, the second is the direct statement of the error.

And grade the fix on the site that produced the defect, **in both directions, in every run**: call
the rule bounded and unbounded at that address and raise if they do not disagree as the
disassembly requires. A one-directional check goes quietly inert if the bounded arm ever stops
firing; the unbounded arm is what keeps the check honest about its own premise.

## A harvester's DISCARD accounting is evidence, and nothing reads it

A sweep that skips inputs should record how many and why — most do. **Nobody reads the column.**

Measured: a size harvester emitted `value=4 site=0x00484510 detail="slot=38 bodies=2 scanned=2
excluded_conf=5"` for a class whose size then sat open for months behind a note reading *"no
witness at all"*. The `value` was quoted in three handoffs. The `detail` beside it says the scan
looked at **2 of 7** available bodies, and the 5 it dropped were the entire answer — the class's
`Save`, `Load`, `SpecifyGui`, `SetPos` and `GetPos`, every one a direct layout witness.

**The rule.** When a witness reports a suspiciously weak value — a floor at the structural minimum,
a count of zero, a window that never narrows — read its own discard accounting *before* concluding
anything about the binary. A weak number beside a large discard count is a statement about the
instrument. Two cheap habits make this automatic:

- **Put the discard count in the value's own row**, not only in the run log, so it survives into the
  artifact and is joinable. (This one did, which is why the diagnosis took minutes once anyone
  looked.)
- **Rank your open questions by discard count once per project.** Here it took a single pass over
  the committed evidence to find that the exclusion fired on exactly **1 of 61** classes carrying
  member rows — and that one was the class nobody could size. A rule that bites once is either
  harmless or load-bearing, and the count does not tell you which; the join does.

## A count can improve for a reason that is not an improvement

A census bucket moved in the healthy direction — `95 laid-out, 7 sized-not-laid-out` → `96 / 6` —
in a round that mutated **nothing** in the program. Mechanism: the census skips struct components
below the *base's* struct length, and the class's recorded base had changed to one with **no struct
at all**, so the skip threshold fell from 56 to 0 and the class's inherited components started
counting as its own.

Nothing was gained. The same census had earlier moved 13 classes the *other* way for the mirror-image
reason: building a base struct made their inherited bytes stop counting.

**The rule: before re-pinning an absolute count, derive the mechanism — and apply the same
scepticism to a bucket that moved in the good direction as to one that moved in the bad.** A count
that improves is the one nobody investigates, which is exactly why a metric drifts into meaning
something other than its definition. Record the mechanism *in the pin's comment*, because the next
reader has only the two numbers and will otherwise book it as progress.

- **A SWEEP'S REACH IS THE NUMBER THAT DECIDES WHAT ITS SILENCE MEANS — MEASURE IT ON THE
  POPULATION YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER FOR, AND PRINT IT ABOVE THE HITS.** A witness can be
  extremely *specific* and still see almost nothing. Measured: a structural witness for missed
  inheritance edges (a virtual body shared by exactly two vtables and no other) fired on **18 of
  92,028** non-edge pairs — decisive-looking — and on only **14 of 288 KNOWN edges, 4.9%**. 270 of
  the 274 it misses have a base with two or more recorded children, so that base's own bodies
  appear in three or more tables and are private to no pair; the witness is structurally confined
  to bases with a single descendant. Nothing in the output hinted at this, and "three candidates,
  nothing else" reads as closure. The reach cost one loop over the calibration set the sweep
  already loads. **A count from a sweep whose reach is unmeasured is a fact about the instrument,
  and the two are only distinguishable after you have measured it.**
- **THE POPULATION A SWEEP RANGES OVER IS PART OF ITS RULE. Ask which side of the join the thing
  you are looking for would be on, and whether that side is the restricted one.** Measured: a
  sweep for *missed* inheritance edges was specified over the hierarchy's 294 known nodes, while
  the binary has 315 vtables. Widening only the CANDIDATE-BASE side to all 315 added exactly one
  hit — and it was the only real edge in the entire result. It could not have been otherwise: the
  defect being hunted **is** the case where the true base is the node no route reached, so
  restricting candidate bases to nodes the routes already reached excludes the answer by
  construction.
- **WHEN A SWEEP IS EXPENSIVE AND ITS REACH IS LOW, LOOK FOR THE INVERTED QUESTION — IT OFTEN HAS
  A COMPLETE ANSWER.** "Which pairs LOOK like a missed edge" was a 92,028-pair search with 4.9%
  reach producing candidates. **"Which vtables has the disassembly never seen installed"** was a
  byte scan of the shipped image with a denominator of 315 producing facts, because every vptr
  store is a 4-byte literal and every one of the 1,044 occurrences could be accounted for. It
  returned 312 installed / 3 invisible / 0 never-installed, and the 3 were exactly 3 of the 21
  tables with no hierarchy row — the *mechanism* for their absence rather than another candidate
  list. The two instruments intersected on one class, which is the confidence rule; the cheap one
  carried the round.
- **A CENSUS WHOSE VALUE IS ITS ZEROS MUST EXPLAIN EVERY ROW, OR ITS ZEROS ARE ITS OWN.** That
  census's first draft classified each occurrence by matching a hand-listed set of opcode pairs,
  and reported two classes as **never constructed anywhere in the program** — a spectacular claim,
  and false. Both stores were `C7 45 00` (`MOV [EBP+0], imm32`), a form the list did not carry.
  The repair is not a longer list: **decode the ModRM/SIB/disp and require the computed
  instruction length to land the immediate exactly at the occurrence**, then RAISE on anything
  still unexplained. The residue bucket is the tell — a census with an "other" pile cannot
  distinguish a real zero from a decoder gap, and the pile is where the answer hides.
- **BEFORE PRICING A ROUND ON WHAT AN APPLY WILL UNLOCK, NAME THE CONSUMER AND CHECK IT IS KEYED
  ON WHAT THE APPLY PRODUCES.** Measured: defining the one constructor in a binary that installs a
  base class's vtable — the ancestry evidence no other route could see — changed **nothing**
  downstream. Re-running all four hierarchy-feeding sweeps produced one content-changed artifact,
  the creation ledger itself. Every route that could *seed* a class into the hierarchy was keyed
  on the class registry, and this class was neither registered nor named, so the new evidence had
  no consumer looking at it. The apply was still correct; the round's headline was not. **The
  check costs one artifact diff and belongs before the apply, not after.**

- **A MEASURED ZERO MUST CARRY THE POPULATION IT WAS MEASURED OVER, OR THE CAVEAT EVAPORATES AND
  THE SENTENCE OUTLIVES IT.** *"No reader was found in the 22 bodies listed under Provenance"* and
  *"a slot the shipped game does not use"* are different claims — one about the search, one about
  the binary — and a findings file that writes the second while meaning the first will be read as
  the second by every later round. Measured: a careful read-only round on one embedded class
  produced three `no evidence` verdicts and **all three were false**, refuted later by bodies it
  had not read. Its numbers were right; its scope words were dropped one sentence after they were
  written. Put the denominator inside the verdict, every time.
- **A ROUND'S OWN "NOT LOOKED AT" LIST IS A PREDICTION OF WHERE ITS ERRORS ARE — READ THE
  EXCLUSIONS BEFORE THE FINDINGS.** The same round honestly listed the two owner families it had
  skipped, and every one of its wrong verdicts came from that list. It was written as a courtesy
  and never used as what it was: a ranked to-do whose first entry falsifies the weakest
  conclusions. When re-opening any prior analysis, take its exclusion list and check it against
  the cells that analysis called empty. Here that was one sweep and it returned three corrections.

## A producer that ALREADY covers a cell and reports `no_evidence` is not "not yet tried"

The false-zero trap has a face that survives every guard on this page, because the zero is
genuinely the producer's own measured output. Measured: a queued item read *"widen the ctype sweep
to track class `X` and add offset `+0x40` to its candidate cells"*. The sweep already tracked `X`.
Its candidate list already carried `(X, 0x40)`. Its committed answer was `no_evidence`, and
applying the queued patch **reproduces that zero into the artifact** — for a cell the binary writes
as a float 45 times.

The gap was never the candidate list; it was **reach**. The sweep's population is export-keyed, the
class is embedded rather than exported, a float is proven only by an x87 mnemonic, and **0 of the 7
x87 bodies is an export** — so the instrument sees 2 of 102 accesses and correctly reports nothing.

**Before widening a producer, check whether it already has the row.** If it does, its zero is a
statement about its own reach and not about the binary, and re-running it converts *"this
instrument cannot look here"* into *"nobody has looked"* — with a fresh timestamp on it. The check
is one grep of the producer's own candidate list against the queued item's text.

## The dominant error in a sweep is rarely the one the brief warns about

A brief that names a hazard buys a rule against that hazard and nothing else. Measured: a sweep
reading consecutive vtable-pointer stores was briefed to fail on **destructor inversion** (the
store order reverses in a destructor). It does — and that hazard accounted for exactly **one** of
the twenty-one orphans it was built to explain.

The real error was structural and unnamed: **157 of 985 in-function stores (16%) install an
EMBEDDED MEMBER's vptr at a non-zero offset.** A flat read proposes 126 edges, 84 of them new, with
one table deriving from **18 different bases** — a shape that is obviously wrong only once you look
at the distribution. The intra-body dataflow fixpoint that attributes each store to an
`(object, offset)` proposes 68, of which **60 are already in the recorded ancestry with zero
contradictions.**

That re-derivation, not any per-edge witness count, is what licensed the 8 new edges. **A
calibration against everything you already know is worth more than a rule against the failure you
predicted** — it prices every error mode at once, including the ones nobody thought to name, and it
tells you the sweep's accuracy in the same run that produces its output.

## A docstring claiming a SCOPE the code never enforced, holding only by accident

Measured: a check's comment said it was *"scoped to the destructor slot on purpose"* and even
named the four shared-member slots a wider check would fire on constantly. **The code scanned all
1066 `(table, slot)` pairs.** The scope was real only because no non-destructor-slot row had ever
*decided* — and one width-preserving type apply (see `applying-changes.md`) removed the accident,
at which point the comment became visibly false and the check began firing.

**A comment describing a restriction the code does not implement is worse than no comment: it is
read as evidence that the case was considered.** When auditing a producer, grep its prose for scope
claims and check each against the loop bounds — a claim this specific (it named the slots!) reads
as a measurement and is not one.

## When a rule has three homes, the HEALTHY copy names the fix

Same incident. The rule *"one array-stride witness per class"* lived in three places: two encoded
it over every slot, one carried a local `DTOR_SLOT_FULL = 38` constant. **That third copy is why
that sweep ran clean on the pass where the other two raised.**

Two things follow, and the second is the one usually missed:

- **The copy that did not fire is evidence, not noise.** It tells you what the rule *should* have
  been, derived from whoever wrote it while thinking about the population rather than about the
  loop. Consolidating to the strictest surviving copy is cheaper than deriving the rule again.
- **A file can hold the precision and throw it away one screen later.** The healthy copy's own
  downstream read was a LAST-ROW-WINS dict over the same rows, which would have made its
  calibration gate print `expected 16 got 1400 MISMATCH` on correct data. Fixing the rule's home
  is not finished until every consumer reads it through that home.

## Sweep for the SIBLINGS THAT DID NOT FIRE — silence for accidental reasons is a fuse

The instance-vs-pattern rule in `SKILL.md` says sweep the pattern. This is the sharper form: when a
producer misreads one body, find the bodies with the same shape that **stayed quiet**, and ask
*why* they were quiet.

Measured: three bodies in one class family walk an embedded array, and only one passed the sweep's
shape filters — because in the other two **the object pointer never appears as an operand-0 memory
base.** That is register allocation, not a rule. A fix that relied on those two staying silent
would have been luck with a two-year fuse: any recompilation, any decompiler improvement, any
retype that changes operand rendering re-arms them.

So grade a candidate fix by whether it depends on the silence. The scope fix adopted here depended
on neither accident and removed **1052 of 1066 pairs (98.7%)** at once; the shape-filter fix would
have handled one body and left two loaded.

## The instrument for your biggest gap may already be RUNNING — check who scans the population

A reach number is a statement about one producer's own population, and every producer's reach
number can be honest while a whole channel is missing. The cheap check is not "can this be
measured" but **"is something already measuring it and reporting a narrower projection?"**

Measured: a size sweep had been calling the per-body scanner over every class's own member
functions for a hundred rounds — 1722 bodies, 100% accepted — and keeping only the scalar
`max(offset)` at six of its seven call sites. The per-offset cells the scanner also returns were
computed and thrown away on every run. Wiring them into an artifact took one new sweep and moved
the project's layout-coverage denominator from **79.4% to 87.1%**, with the count of classes
carrying no field row at all going **62 → 5**.

Nothing was broken. The scan was correct, the sweep's own headline was correct, and the discard
was deliberate when it was written, because that sweep needed a bound and not a layout. **Before
building a witness, grep for the population, not for the answer** — who already enumerates these
bodies, these addresses, these rows? A discarded intermediate is the cheapest evidence in any
project, because the expensive half is already built and calibrated.

## Classify your producers by the KIND OF BODY they read — the missing channel is then obvious

The same project's five layout producers read, respectively: a copy constructor, a construction
chain, a subsystem initialiser, a serialisation body, and a registration table. Written out as a
table, one column wide, the gap is unmissable: **all five are INITIALISATION channels.** A cell
that is never initialised where a scan can see it and never serialised is invisible to all five
*at once*, and its missing row reads as *"nobody has looked"* when it means *"no instrument here
can look."*

That audit costs one column in a table and it is not the same as any per-producer reach number,
because a producer that has never been able to see a population correctly reports nothing about
it. Do it whenever several producers feed one denominator:

| producer | artifact | what kind of body does it read? |
|---|---|---|

The row that repeats is the blind spot. Here the missing kind was the plainest one available —
**a class's own member functions** — which no producer read because every producer had been built
to answer a question about construction.

## Before implementing a QUEUED FIX, read the known positive

A queued item usually carries a prescription as well as a diagnosis, and the prescription decays
the same way the blocker does — except it reads as finished work, so nobody re-derives it. Measured:
a broken inlined-helper detector had been queued for rounds with the fix written out —
*"normalise operands the way part A's shape-key machinery already does"* — and **two reads of the
known positive refuted it.**

The first read was of the detector's own candidate filter: the known positive's body contains a
`CALL`, and the filter dropped any body containing one, so it **never reached the matcher**. The
assertion's message said *"shows NO inline occurrences"* — a **skipped** candidate reported as a
measured zero, inside the text of the check that existed to catch exactly that.

The second read was of the real occurrence. The helper's body is four instructions; at the site it
is **two**, because the compiler inlined it *and constant-folded its argument*, so one instruction
vanished and a register operand became an immediate. No byte match, no shape key and no register
normalisation relates those sequences — and the prescribed machinery preserves register names
anyway, so it would not have closed even the smaller problem.

**So: open the known positive before writing code against the prescription.** Both refutations were
one corpus read each. And note what made the prescription plausible: it named a real mechanism
(re-encoded registers) that would matter in some other binary. A fix can be a correct general idea
and still be the wrong fix here.

## Match what SURVIVES the transformation, not the encoding

When a compiler transformation is what hid your population, ask what the transformation cannot
change. Inlining rewrites the instruction sequence freely — register allocation, argument folding,
instruction count — but it does not change **what the code is about**: the member displacements it
touches and the absolute addresses it calls. Those are the same constants at every site.

So the signature to match is the ordered sequence of **invariants**, not bytes and not a normalised
mnemonic shape:

- a memory operand's displacement, where the base register is not the stack pointer or frame
  pointer (a stack slot is not an object's invariant), and the displacement is either large enough
  not to be noise or is itself an absolute address;
- an absolute call or jump target.

An occurrence is then a contiguous run of the same invariants within a span. Measured: 0 hits for
the known positive under a byte matcher, **76** under this one — and a second helper nobody had
flagged, with **51 inline sites against 3 surviving call sites**, i.e. 94% of its usage invisible to
any call-keyed census.

Three things keep it honest, because this matcher is weaker than a byte match:

- **A distinctiveness floor, in the code and counted.** Two invariants minimum, at least one of
  them rare by construction (an absolute target or a global address). Two small displacements match
  half the binary; refuse those and print how many were refused.
- **Reach above the hits.** Here 14 of 5,649 functions (0.25%) had a usable signature, with the
  five refusal reasons enumerated. A silence from an instrument with that reach closes nothing.
- **Grade against an independently measured number, as a BAND.** A different instrument had counted
  96 sites for the known positive; this one finds 76, and the span and contiguity limits can only
  lose sites, so the count is a floor. Pin the band, report the floor, and name the two unmeasured
  causes of the gap rather than explaining it away.

## Prefer the mechanism that predicts EVERY case to the one that explains the headline

A plausible mechanism that accounts for the case you noticed is not the mechanism. Measured: a size
witness was known to under-report, and the offered explanation was a control-flow edge clearing the
analysis state early. It was refuted by reading the code — the clear exists but is paired with a
restore that round-trips correctly — and the real cause was three lines elsewhere: on a call to a
recognised allocator the scanner **replaced** its alias tracker with a fresh one, destroying the
`object` alias the prologue had established.

The way to tell them apart is to demand prediction across the whole population, not agreement on
the headline. The replacement rule — *"the reported value is the maximum cell before the first
allocator call"* — predicted **11 of 11** committed values, and the predictions that matter are the
ones that do not look like the headline: the headline cases all reported the same small number, and
a hunt keyed on that number found only 7 of the 11. Four more had values of 188, 204, 212 and 1180,
and each was exactly the last cell before the allocator call.

Two corollaries worth carrying:

- **A population defined by the symptom's value is the wrong population.** Key it on the mechanism.
- **Check which direction the defect runs, because the other direction is usually worse.** The same
  re-seed that loses cells can also *gain* them: once the tracker points at a freshly allocated
  object, its offsets get attributed to the original object. Losing a cell leaves a bound open;
  gaining one closes it **wrongly**, and no conservation check sees that. In this codebase one
  consumer of the scanner was guarded against the unwanted re-seed and three were not.

## A DIFFERENTIAL is only as honest as its configuration, and the configuration belongs to the CONSUMER

When a library takes a flag that disables the behaviour you suspect, a differential is the right
instrument: run it both ways over the real population and diff. It beats re-deriving the "true"
answer by hand, because a disagreement between your implementation and the library's is
unattributable, while a diff is attributable by construction.

The trap is running a configuration nobody uses. Measured: a scanner re-seeds its alias tracker when
the body calls an allocator, and the probe was built to measure the damage. Its first draft scanned
every population in one mode and reported **190 of 218** bodies damaged. That number measured the
probe. For one of the three populations — factory bodies — the object *is* the allocation, and the
producer scans those in the other mode precisely so the first re-seed is the *wanted* one; disabling
it there does not repair anything, it deletes the object (one class's extent went from 1232 to
`None`). Resolving the mode per row from the artifact that records it cut the damaged population to
**45 of 1961**.

So before the diff: **find every call site of the thing under test and record which configuration
each consumer passes.** One `grep` for the function name across the producers. And if the
configuration varies per row, resolve it per row from a committed artifact rather than picking the
common case — that is the difference between a measurement and an average over two different
questions.

## The NARROWING CHAIN, and when to stop

A mechanism suggests a population; the population is not the damage. Each question below was one
pass over the same data, and each one changed the answer by an order of magnitude:

| question | answer |
|---|---|
| how many bodies exhibit the mechanism? | 218 |
| how many are in a configuration where it is WRONG? | 45 |
| how many wrong cells does that produce? | 254 |
| how many of those reached a committed artifact? | 130 |
| how many artifact rows have **no other** witness? | **7 of 1681 (0.42%)** |

**The stopping rule is not "the number is small enough". It is "there is no further question that
changes what a repair would do".** Here the chain stopped at 7 because the repair removes exactly
those rows; every other suspect row is also witnessed by a body that never exhibits the mechanism, so
the repair leaves it untouched.

Two things this buys beyond accuracy. The last row is a list somebody can check by hand, which a
percentage never is. And the intermediate rows are the honest reach statement: *"254 cells are wrong
and 7 rows move"* is a different and far more useful sentence than either number alone — it says the
instrument is noisy and the artifact is nearly clean, which is what decides whether to repair the
library or the rows.

Report the whole chain. A round that publishes only the first number will be believed, and a round
that publishes only the last one looks like it got lucky.

## A PREDICTION made with the broken instrument inherits the break

The sharpest form of measuring-with-the-thing-you-are-testing, and it hides because the measurement
is *correct* when it is taken.

Measured. A scanner's alias tracker was destroyed whenever the body called an allocator, so a census
of the damage used this proxy: *a cell whose instruction sits after an allocator call was measured
from the allocation, not from the object.* The proxy was **exact** — precisely because the defect had
destroyed the object's tracker, every post-allocator access necessarily came from the allocation. The
census predicted that repairing the scanner would remove **7** rows from a committed artifact and
change **3** artifacts.

The repair removed **5** rows and changed **8** artifacts. The two surviving rows are now witnessed
*after* an allocator call by the object's tracker, which is the entire point of the repair — so the
proxy that made the census exact is the thing the repair invalidates. Worse, the same proxy was
re-asserted as a post-repair "contract" and reported **39 violations, every one of them the repair
working**, including a cell the census itself had listed as lost.

Two rules:

- **Before carrying a defect-era measurement forward as a prediction, name what the proxy depends on
  and ask whether the repair removes it.** A proxy whose exactness comes from the defect predicts
  nothing about the fix. You can still use it as the BASELINE — keep a flag that restores the old
  behaviour and pin its numbers — but not as the forecast.
- **Grade a repair with instruments that do not share its assumption.** Here the verdict came from
  calibrations the round did not write: a member-body arm that raises if any body touches past its
  class's known size went from 7 to **8 exact hits** over 263 bodies, a derived-floor arm lost only
  its non-exact comparison, and no producer raised anywhere in the pass. None of that could be
  confused with the repair grading itself.

## A census over a CHANNEL is not a census over the artifacts that consume it

The same round's second miss. The census diffed one scanner output — the per-offset cell list and its
two maxima — over three body populations, and named the three artifacts it knew about. The repair
changed **eight**: two more size artifacts, two more layout artifacts, and one unrelated file where a
single column moved without any verdict changing.

Nothing was harmed, which is the point: the under-count cost nothing *this time*, and a census is
supposed to be the thing that tells you when it would. **Enumerate the channel's consumers, not just
its rows** — one `grep` for the function name across the producers, which is the same check the
configuration trap above needs. Then the census names artifacts, and a diff outside that list is a
finding rather than a surprise.

And adjudicate the inert ones anyway. A column that changes without changing a decision still has to
be written down, because an unexplained entry in a regeneration diff is indistinguishable from
damage, and *"it looked harmless"* is not a record.

---

## When several sources feed one index, ask what they have in COMMON before believing the reach

An index built from four different artifacts reads like breadth, and the count of sources is the
thing everyone quotes. Measured on one project: a class-size sweep resolved a constructor through
four separate sources — a hierarchy edge table, an attribution table, a widget table, a subsystem
table — and **every one of them keyed on a FACTORY or an ALLOCATION site.** They do not fail
independently; they fail together, on exactly the shape none of them can see: a class whose every
instance is a static built from the C-runtime initializer table, with an immediate `this` and no
allocation anywhere.

**39 of 76 classes in that tier carried no constructor row**, and 25 of the 39 were named by no
source at all. In the artifact that reads as *"nothing to measure here"*. It means *"no route
reaches here"* — the distinction this whole file exists for, arriving through the index rather than
through the sweep.

The tell was available without any new measurement, and was missed for two rounds: a previous round
had **added two sources to that index and the reach for this population did not move**, because the
new sources shared the first one's assumption. **Adding a source that shares the existing blind spot
widens a count and closes nothing.** Before adding the fifth, write down the one sentence every
existing source's key satisfies, and check whether the population you are trying to reach satisfies
it. If it does not, the fifth source of the same kind will not help either.

## A discipline sentence is inherited by the next consumer, and usually should not be

A sweep printed, for a call it could not resolve inside a constructor:

    this-call 0x... unresolved (left out -- lower bound discipline: absence proves nothing)

That is **correct about the question it was written for** — base-class edges, where an unresolved
call genuinely proves nothing. It is **wrong about the second thing the same scan feeds**: the
constructor's write extent. The callee writes through the *same object*, so dropping it understates
a LOWER bound — and a separate rule then subtracts that bound from a derived class's first own write
to produce an UPPER bound. Understate the lower and the upper comes out below the true size; the two
meet, and the row is recorded as an exactly-pinned size that is wrong, with every check green.

The comment is what made the omission durable. It reads as a considered decision, so nobody re-derives
it. **When a second consumer starts reading a scan's output, re-derive every "deliberately left out"
line for that consumer**, and say which consumer each one is about.

## A rule's soundness is a property of the rule AND its population — moving the population reopens it

An acceptance test can be correct for years because its candidates arrive pre-filtered, and fail
immediately when you point it at raw bytes.

Measured: *"a body whose LAST store of a known vtable through a `this`-register installs this class's
own table is this class's constructor"* had never been wrong. Its candidates came from factory
artifacts that had already been screened. Re-sourced from **every occurrence of the table address in
`.text`**, the identical test admitted **7 calibration violations of 17 graded** — because a
constructor that builds an *embedded* instance of the base through a second register looks exactly
like one that *is* the base. The embedded-member channel that exists for precisely this case only
sees the store while the alias tracker still holds a delta for that register, and linear tracking can
lose the register while the `this`-set still contains it.

So: **when you change where a population comes from, the acceptance test is a new claim, not an
inherited one.** Re-calibrate it against whatever independently-decided rows you already have, and
report the narrowing table — candidate narrowings against violations-cleared and target-population-kept
— rather than a single chosen rule. The narrowing that survives is a finding; the one you would have
guessed usually is not. (In that run, the narrowing aimed squarely at the mechanism —
"reject bodies that store a table at a non-zero offset" — cleared **nothing**, because the whole
defect was that the store was never recorded there.)

## One class, one constructor is an ASSUMPTION, and C++ overloads break it

A sweep stored one constructor body per class and **raised if a second was found**, with the comment
*"one class, one construction body is the assumption every write_max row rests on"*. The raise makes
the assumption look defended. It only makes a violation loud in the one route that happened to find
two — and it never fires for a class the index reaches through a single source.

Measured: one class had **four** constructor bodies, whose write extents were **100, 96, 60 and 32**.
Whichever body a route names decides the class. Because a second rule converts that extent into an
upper bound, three of the four produced an exactly-pinned size that was wrong.

**The fix is not to pick the right body. It is to make the measurement independent of the pick.**
Here, all four constructors handed the object to one shared initializer with the `this` register
unchanged, and folding that callee's write extent into each caller's made all four measure 100 — and,
graded against a class whose size another channel had already decided, reproduced that size exactly
where the unfolded scan reproduced nothing. When a per-class quantity varies by which member function
you happen to read, the quantity is under-specified, not the reading.

---

## A VACUOUS value is harmless in the channel it was measured in and dangerous in the one that CONSUMES it

Calibrate a new witness the obvious way and you grade it against what it claims. A lower bound
claims `value <= truth`, so you check it against independently decided truths, and 0 violations
means the witness is sound. **That check cannot see what a second rule does with the number.**

Measured: a new constructor-extent witness passed its calibration cleanly, and **7 of its 19 rows
carried the value 4** — the bare vtable-pointer store, a constructor that initialises nothing else.
As lower bounds those rows are correct and cost nothing; every one of those classes was already
sized by another channel. But a *different* rule used that number as a THRESHOLD — *"the lowest
offset a derived constructor writes AT OR ABOVE the base's extent is where the derived's own
members begin"* — and `offset >= 4` excludes nothing, so the rule returned the derived's first
write, which is an inherited cell. One class produced an **upper bound of 188 against a class
already decided at 208**, and only the adjudicator's own containment raise stopped it.

**Before shipping a witness, enumerate every rule that consumes its VALUE, and ask what each does
with the weakest value the witness can legitimately produce.** A lower bound's weakest legitimate
value is its floor; a rule that SUBTRACTS it turns that floor into a confidently wrong answer in
the opposite direction. The calibration and the consumer are different questions and only one of
them was being asked.

And when you add the guard, **write the one that states the mechanism, not the one that happens to
correlate.** Three refusals went in: *the narrowing refused a candidate so the accepted set is
incomplete* (caught the incident, but only because that class happened to have refusals), *the
threshold is the bare vptr width so it excludes nothing* (the actual mechanism), and *the result
contradicts an independently decided size* (the soundness condition itself, and vacuous on current
data — which is said in the code beside it, because an assertion nobody notices cannot fire is the
failure `references/assertions.md` exists for).

## A fixture that HAND-INJECTS the answer cannot predict the producer

Copying the evidence directory, editing the cells you expect a round to produce, and running the
denominator tool over the copy is a genuinely useful measurement — of *"if these cells were
decided, what would the numbers be"*. It is **not** a prediction of the round, and the two get
written down in the same sentence.

Measured: a census predicted a denominator would fall from 10 to 6 on the strength of a fixture
that wrote six sizes into a copy. The real adjudicator produced **one**, and the denominator fell
to 9 — because the other five needed an inference rule that did not exist. The census's own PROSE
said so, in the same paragraph as the number.

**State what a fixture perturbs and what it is silent about, in the sentence that quotes it.** The
fixture answers the consumer's arithmetic; the producer's behaviour is a separate question and
needs the producer. Where the two appear together in a round record, the one derived from the
actual producer wins, and a disagreement between the prose and the number in the same paragraph is
a finding rather than a typo.

## A census is SPENT by the repair it licenses — re-base it, do not excuse it

A pre-round census defines its population by the defect it measures: *"the classes no route
reaches"*, *"the descriptors that are unnamed"*. The round then fixes that, and the census's
population is **empty by construction**. Its vacuity raise fires on the next verification pass, and
it is RIGHT: a census whose defect has vanished is stale, not passed.

The cheap response is an excuse list, and projects accumulate them. The better one costs a few
lines: **reconstruct the pre-round state from the committed artifact.** If the repair's own rows
are distinguishable — a `route=` tag in a detail column, a provenance field — exclude them and the
original population comes back exactly. Guard the reconstruction with a raise on an empty exclusion
set, or a later spelling change silently turns the population back into the post-repair one and the
census reads as clean while measuring nothing.

Measured: doing this recovered every one of the census's numbers unchanged (37 of 76, 39, 27, and
seven pinned values), and kept alive the question *"what does this route buy and is it sound"* for
every future round that touches the producer. An excuse would have retired it.

**Watch for the second circularity while you are there.** The repair had DECIDED one size using the
new route, so the census's calibration — which read every size artifact including the pipeline's own
output — would have graded the route against itself. The first fix was too broad: excluding every
class the route emitted a row for collapsed the graded population from 17 to 5, because most of
those classes had an independently decided size all along and only one came from the route. **The
correct exclusion is by SOURCE, not by class:** read the artifacts that DECIDE sizes and never the
one this pipeline writes. And say the denominator moved — a narrowing that clears a calibration by
shrinking it has not cleared anything, and a rule that newly "passes" on 7 rows where it failed on
11 has not improved.

---

## A CALIBRATION IS SPENT BY THE ROUND THAT RUNS BEFORE IT — not only by the repair it licenses

This file already records that *a census is spent by the repair it licenses*. The corollary is
sharper and was paid for separately: **a queued rule's calibration is a measurement of the tree
it was taken on, and the round that ships between is enough to invalidate it.**

Measured. A round was queued with the most complete design its project's backlog had carried —
a stated rule, a narrowing, **42 of 42 clean** against committed ground truth, a base-rate check
proving the narrowing did not pre-select the answer, a named poison, and three implementation
hazards. All of it was computed one commit before the round that immediately preceded it. That
round added 19 rows of the very witness kind the rule thresholds on. Re-derived against the tree
the work would actually run on:

| | as queued | at the tree it would ship on |
|---|---|---|
| population | 146 of 296 pairs | **175 of 296** |
| fires | 98 | **119** |
| narrowed, clean | **42 of 42** | **51 of 58** |
| error inside the narrowing | 0% | **12.1%** |
| error outside it | — | **8.2%** |

The narrowing was not merely unprotective, it was **anti-protective**, and the base-rate check
the design leaned on *still passed* — so the narrowing was honest in the sense the design tested
and useless in the sense the design needed. **Re-derive every load-bearing number in a queued
design against the tree you are standing on, before writing a line of it.** A design document is
a set of untested claims wearing a table.

**And the caveat a design disarms with a zero is the one to open first.** The same design
recorded its own worry honestly: *"this configuration occurs **0 of N times** in the calibration
population while all the targets sit exactly there — a gap in the reassuring direction with no
exemplar."* At the shipping tree it occurred **14 of 175**, and one was wrong against ground
truth. **A measured zero that a later round can turn non-zero is not a reassurance, it is an
unrun test.** Read "no exemplar" as *"this rule has never been tested where it is about to be
used"*, which is a stop rather than a footnote.

## A CONSTRUCTOR EXTENT MEASURES WHICH INSTRUCTIONS THE SCANNER SAW, NOT WHICH MEMBERS EXIST

Any rule of the form *"this body writes nothing above offset X, therefore the object has nothing
above X"* inherits two failures, and both are on the side the rule usually does not constrain.

1. **A sub-object constructor called at a non-zero offset is invisible.**
   `LEA ECX,[ESI+0x268]; CALL CFogOfWar::CFogOfWar` builds an embedded member, contributes
   nothing to the enclosing body's write extent, and makes a 672-byte class read as 616 — the
   exact figure the base's own extent gives, so it lands precisely on the boundary the rule was
   least tested at. Ground truth was the allocator immediate three instructions earlier
   (`PUSH 0x2a0`), and six sibling classes with the same base allocate the smaller size and are
   predicted correctly.
2. **A constructor is not obliged to touch every member.** A class that allocates 144 and whose
   entire own constructor body is one vtable store has 16 real bytes that nothing initialises
   where the scan can see them; the serialiser writes them.

Neither failure is detectable by tightening the *other* side of the comparison, which is what a
narrowing on the base's extent does. If you must ship such a rule, grade it against an
ALLOCATION witness — an `operator new` immediate is the object's size by contract, and it is
independent of every construction-scan artifact.

## PREFER A NARROW WITNESS WITH A CHECKABLE FAILURE MODE TO A BROAD ONE WHOSE ERRORS ARE INVISIBLE

The witness that replaced the refuted rule above reaches **7 of 304 classes (2.3%)** and decided
**five** sizes where the broad rule claimed three. Two properties bought that:

- **It is arithmetic, not inference.** For an object the linker placed at a fixed address, the
  nearest address above it that the program treats as a `this` belongs to another object, so the
  instance cannot reach it. No premise about how the compiler lays out members.
- **Its single failure mode is checkable.** It can only be wrong by naming a neighbour that lies
  *inside* the object — and the object's own construction extent is an independent LOWER bound,
  so exactly that case makes lower exceed upper and the tool refuses instead of reporting. The
  poison is the rule anyone would first write (*"the next absolute address referenced above the
  instance"*), it fires on real data, and it fires because a static object's own members are
  reached by absolute address too.

**Say the reach as a fraction, above the rows, and say whether the population is a SAMPLE or a
COMPLETE ENUMERATION.** Here it was an enumeration — the program heap-allocates almost
everything — so a silence from the witness closes nothing, and the tool prints that sentence
itself rather than leaving a reader to infer coverage from a healthy-looking count.

---

## "A WRONG X MISATTRIBUTES A WHOLE CLASS" IS A CLAIM ABOUT CONSEQUENCE — sweep the artifacts before pricing it

A backlog carried an item as its highest-value work for two rounds, on the strength of one read
instruction showing a scanner attributing another object's vtable store to the body under scan.
The mechanism was real and reproduced exactly. The consequence, measured across **all 145
committed artifacts, column by column: zero wrong rows.**

Two things made it harmless, and both are the kind of fact you only get by looking:

- **The corruption is total rather than partial, which is safer.** The scanner REPLACED its
  notion of "where the object is" wholesale on an allocation and nothing ever restored the
  callee-saved copy, so **no clean record ever followed a contaminated one** (measured 0). Any
  consumer comparing against an independently known answer is then immune for the *whole* list,
  not merely its last element. A partial corruption would have been far worse.
- **Most of the population was not the defect at all.** Of 231 bodies carrying a re-seeded
  record, **218 were factory-shaped** — the allocation genuinely IS the object there, and the
  re-seed is what makes the answer right. Only 13 had the true defect shape. A census that
  counted "bodies with a re-seeded record" would have reported an 18× exaggeration.

**Price a defect by what a consumer does with the value, not by how wrong the value is**, and
state the artifact sweep as a fraction with its denominator. "Latent" and "live" are different
rounds.

## A PROBE'S POPULATION MUST BE THE DANGEROUS CONSUMER'S SCAN SET, NOT THE ARTIFACT'S FEED SET

The first draft of that census covered the three populations that feed committed artifacts and
reported 18 records over 17 bodies. The consumer that mattered most walked a **depth-4 callee
closure** that none of the three contained — and *its stopping condition was the very list under
test*, so the defect steered the walk itself. Adding that population gave **70 records over 29
bodies**, and the worked instruction the backlog had cited for two rounds appeared **only** there.

Before believing a census, ask which bodies the dangerous consumer actually scans — not which
bodies feed the artifact. The two sets differ exactly where a recursive resolver is involved, and
that is also where the defect compounds.

## A DEFECT FIXED IN A CONSUMER WILL BE RE-FOUND — the second and third fixes are evidence, not cure

Of 24 files reading one library's output, three filtered the marker that distinguishes a bad
record; nine took the record with no test at all, one of them **inside the library itself**. One
of the three said so in its own comment: *"the same defect fixed for [the other field], one
artifact further downstream."*

So the rule had been written down, the marker existed, and the fix had been applied — three
separate times, in three separate consumers, and never in the producer. **When you patch a shared
library's output at a call site, write down which library invariant was missing, not just what you
did about it**; and when you meet a defect in a shared scanner, grep for an earlier patch of it
before building anything. A second consumer-side fix is the signal that the first one was in the
wrong place.

---

## A CENSUS THAT LICENSES A REPAIR DOES NOT PRICE IT

This file already says a census is spent by the repair it licenses. Here is the other half, paid
for separately: **a census establishes that a defect exists and how far it reaches; it says
nothing about what fixing it is worth.**

Measured. A census recorded twelve classes *"whose bodies prove extents of 192-317 while six carry
a recorded extent of 4 and six carry no row"*, and the queue treated that as the round's payoff.
Checked against the artifacts one round later: **all twelve already had a decided size** from an
independent channel. The repair moves no decision at all, and its real remaining value is one
class where a vacuous value blocks a downstream rule.

Nothing in the census was wrong. It measured what the defect touches, which is the question it was
built for, and then the reach was read as value. **Before scheduling a repair, join its named
population against what the artifacts already decide** — the difference between "this evidence is
missing" and "this evidence is missing and nothing else supplies it" is the entire payoff, and it
is one join.


## A LINEAR DISASSEMBLY SWEEP HALTS AT THE FIRST UNDECODABLE BYTE, AND THE LOSS IS SILENT AND STABLE

A harvester that decodes a whole code section in one pass — `list(md.disasm(section_bytes,
section_va))` with capstone, and the same shape in other engines — stops at the first byte it
cannot decode and does **not** resynchronise. Compiled code sections are full of such bytes:
jump tables, alignment padding, data the compiler interleaved.

Measured on a 1999 MSVC/x86 retail binary: the sweep decoded 102,680 instructions and stopped
partway through a 0xd1000-byte `.text`. **4,110 of 5,649 known function starts — 72.8% — were
never decoded**, along with 208 of 569 allocator call sites. The producer's own "body too long"
counter read 0 and its census carried no entry for the loss, because nothing in the pipeline
knows the difference between *"this function decoded to nothing"* and *"this function was never
reached"*.

Three properties make it worse than an ordinary bug:

- **It presents as a measured zero.** The artifact says a class has no allocation. That reads as
  evidence about the binary and is evidence about where the decoder stopped.
- **A stability harness cannot see it.** Regenerate and byte-compare, and *both sides* of the
  comparison come from the same halted decoder. A 72.8% blind spot is perfectly stable, so it
  reads as perfect health.
- **It is invisible to review.** The five-line constructor that builds the index is the least
  interesting code in the file.

**The guard is one assertion and it does not exist in most projects: a producer that decodes a
section linearly must assert that its decode reached the section end, or that its decoded-start
set covers the committed function table.** Either one turns a silent 72.8% loss into a refusal.
Then sweep the pattern rather than the instance — in that project only 2 of 7 callers of the
disassembler used the whole-section shape, and the other one turned out to be measurably
unaffected (0 of 153 addresses of interest lay past the halt), which is a result worth recording
rather than a worry to carry.

## A ROUTE'S SILENCE IS EVIDENCE ABOUT THE INSTRUMENT, AND THE REASON FOR IT IS OFTEN THE LEAD

A project had a witness that bounds an object's size by the address of whatever the linker placed
after it. It was silent on every one of four open classes, and correctly so: a complete
enumeration showed **0 of 11** vtable stores for those classes had an absolute destination, so
none has a statically placed instance.

The round nearly stopped there. But *why* the witness is silent is that all four objects are
built by an allocator — and the allocation size immediate is sitting in the same body as the
vtable store, three instructions away. Three of the four sizes were recoverable exactly.

**When a witness returns a clean measured zero, ask what shape of object produces that zero.**
That shape almost always has a witness of its own, and the zero is the pointer to it. Read the
zero as "this instrument cannot look here", never as "there is nothing here" — and note that the
artifact's own `confidence=none` spells the first as the second.

## A MEASUREMENT WORTH RECORDING IS WORTH A PRODUCER, OR SAY SO IN THE SAME BREATH

Two of the three sizes that round recovered had **already been measured**, correctly, in earlier
rounds: one findings file recorded both allocation immediates in a table, and another named the
exact instruction of the third and the reason the sweep missed it. Both were right. Both were
inert for months, because a number in a prose table or a `note` column is not re-derivable, cannot
be swept, and is read by nothing.

This is the same failure as a decided value living only in a script literal, and it has the same
fix. When a round measures something it is not going to fold, the honest close is either a
producer that re-derives it or an explicit line saying *this is recorded and nothing consumes it*
— otherwise the next round pays to measure it again, and will not know it is the second time.


## THE FIX FOR A HALTING LINEAR SWEEP IS TO DECODE PER FUNCTION, AND THE GUARD IS COVERAGE OF AN INDEPENDENT INDEX

The halting-sweep trap above says what goes wrong. This is what to do about it, measured on the
same binary.

**Decode each known function separately, bounded by the next function start.** Consumers of a
disassembly index almost always read *from a function start*, so nothing between functions is ever
consulted; decoding per function means an undecodable byte costs that one function's tail instead
of the rest of the section. Coverage went from 1,539 of 5,649 known starts to **5,649 of 5,649**,
and the residual became a list: 19 functions (0.34%) stopping short, 1,520 bytes or 0.18% of the
section, fourteen of them one-to-eight-byte alignment tails.

**State the guard against an independently recorded index, never against the decoder.** Do not ask
the decoder whether it finished — ask whether every entry in the function table you already have
decoded to at least one instruction. That is checkable without trusting the thing being checked,
and it is set arithmetic over two things the producer already holds.

**A lookup that can mean both "empty" and "never reached" needs a counter at the call site.** The
scanner here opened `body = index.body(f); if not body: return`. That single line is why a 72.8%
loss produced no symptom: nothing distinguished a function with nothing in it from a function the
decoder never got to, so no counter moved and the producer's fifteen self-checks all passed.

**And the baseline arm must FAIL the new check.** When you keep the old behaviour behind a flag for
a differential diff, invert the new guard under that flag so the arm has to *find* the defect. An
arm that quietly started working would otherwise pass silently, and the differential would compare
two identical things while reporting success.

**Where to look for the next one: the producers nothing regenerates.** This defect survived because
the producer was deliberately excluded from the stability harness — for a correct reason, since it
needed files the harness's host could not reach — so nothing had re-run it since the day it was
written. An exclusion is a correct engineering decision and simultaneously the condition under
which a silent loss can live forever. Audit the excluded set first.

## A ROUND'S OWN DIFF IS WHAT IT THOUGHT IT CHANGED; THE STABILITY PASS IS WHAT IT ACTUALLY CHANGED

A repair to one producer was diffed carefully: three artifacts, three rows, each adjudicated. The
confirming stability pass then refused the round over a **fourth** artifact, from a producer the
round had not touched — one added row, downstream of a class that had just become sized for the
first time.

It was a gain, and it moved a second denominator the round had not claimed. But the round had
already written "three artifacts moved" into its own record, and that sentence was wrong.

**Run the stability pass before writing the round's numbers down, not after.** The diff you compute
covers the producers you know you touched. The pass covers the ones you did not think about, which
is the entire reason it exists — and its finding is as likely to be a consequence you should keep
as a regression you should revert. Adjudicate it; never re-baseline it silently; and correct the
record rather than the measurement.


## A QUEUED ROUTE IS A CLAIM ABOUT A PRODUCER THAT STILL RUNS

A backlog item said to fold a recovered value through an artifact that already carried it. The
artifact did. Its producer **could not run at all**: a disjointness check at the top of it refused
on 723 rows, because the project's naming had progressed and the population the artifact describes
is no longer the population its rule defines. Confirmed by running the *committed* script
unmodified, so it was not something the round introduced — and the artifact was stale in
membership besides, 51 rows describing a set that had become 58, with 12 of the 51 no longer
qualifying.

An earlier lesson here says to re-derive a queued design's **numbers** against the tree you are
standing on. This adds the other half: **re-run its producer.** An artifact is a claim its
producer could once make; whether it can still make it is a separate fact, and for a producer
nothing regenerates, nobody has checked.

## BEFORE BUILDING A WITNESS, CHECK WHETHER A PRODUCER ALREADY COMPUTES IT AND MERELY DECLINES TO WRITE IT DOWN

With the queued route dead, the obvious move was a new sweep: its own decoder, its own dataflow,
its own calibration. It was unnecessary. An existing producer's fixpoint already recorded every
allocation's size and every vtable stored into it, for the whole binary. What was scoped was the
**emit** — its artifacts covered 45 tables of a particular kind, by design and correctly, and the
rest of the computation was simply discarded at write time.

The round became one new artifact from the same run and the same attribution rule with the filter
removed, inheriting that producer's existing calibration against an independent artifact. **Scoping
lives in the emit far more often than in the rule, and changing an emit is a much smaller claim
than changing a rule.** Read the producer before proposing its replacement.

## A WITNESS THAT AGREES IS CORROBORATION AND MUST BE ADDED, NEVER SUBSTITUTED

Folded unconditionally, the new witness took over three classes another artifact had already
decided. The sizes were identical to the byte — and each row lost the witness that had done the
deciding, and the note recording *how*. Nothing failed. The diff is what showed it.

Two rules follow. **Fold a new witness only for the population nothing else decides**, and print
the agreements separately as corroboration. And **assert the agreement where two sources speak**:
they are usually the same rule over nested populations, so a disagreement is a defect in one of
them rather than a judgement call, and it should raise instead of silently picking a side.

Note where this defect lived. A ratchet that refuses named attributions becoming empty could not
see it, because the vacating happened inside a **fold** rather than an edit. A guard scoped to one
mechanism does not cover the same damage arriving through another.

## CALIBRATE A NEW WITNESS AGAINST THE TIERS IT DOES NOT FEED, AND POISON THE UNGRADABLE CASE

Grade a new size or layout witness against independently decided values — and specifically **not**
against the artifact that consumes it, which would let the witness confirm itself one hop away.
Here: 16 of 68 rows graded against four upstream artifacts, 0 disagreements.

The arm worth copying is the third one. A check that greps for disagreements passes trivially when
**nothing is gradable**, printing a healthy row count the whole time. So poison the empty
*intersection*, not just the empty population: an uncalibrated witness whose grading set is empty
is the failure this catches, and it is invisible to the other two arms.

## A PERCENTAGE IS THE WRONG HEADLINE FOR A MEASURE WHOSE DENOMINATOR THE WORK ITSELF GROWS

A coverage figure fell from 86.9% to 83.6% in a round where nothing became less covered: the
numerator rose, and the denominator grew more, because deciding a class's size is what puts that
class's bytes into the coverage denominator in the first place.

So a size round makes a layout-coverage fraction fall **by construction**, and the gate that
tracks numerator and denominator separately was right to pass it. State both numbers. A single
percentage in a round summary reads as a regression to anyone scanning it, including the next
session.


## A WITNESS'S BLIND SPOT LIVES IN ITS OPERAND PARSER, AND THE ARTIFACT NEVER SAYS SO

A coverage measure would not move for one class, and every sweep that should have moved it was
healthy. The cause was one sentence in the operand parser those sweeps share: *"scaled-index
operands are deliberately not matched, because an indexed access says nothing about a fixed field
offset."* Correct for the question that parser answers, and it means an **array member** was
uncoverable by the entire channel — not unmeasured, *unmeasurable*.

The artifact reported those bytes as uncovered, which reads as "nobody has looked" and meant "this
instrument cannot look". Same confusion as an honest `confidence=none`, one level further down.

**When a denominator will not move for a population, read the PARSER of the witness that should
have moved it, not only the sweep.** A sweep's population is visible in its output; its parser's
refusals are not visible anywhere.

## A STRENGTH-REDUCED ADDRESS COMPUTATION MEANS THE OPERAND IS ONLY THE LAST STEP

Two traps in reading an array access off x86, both of which a first implementation hit and only a
hand-reading calibration caught:

- **The rendered scale is not the element stride.** MSVC turns `n * 68` into
  `MOV EDX,EAX; SHL EDX,0x4; ADD EDX,EAX` (= 17n) and then addresses `[ECX + EDX*0x4 + 0x2cc]`.
  Read the scale off the operand and you get 4; the tool duly reported an array of **136**
  elements where the truth is **8**, wrong by exactly the factor the compiler reduced out, and
  wrong with a healthy-looking row. The stride is a property of the whole arithmetic chain, so the
  index register's multiplier has to be resolved within the body.
- **The object is not always the base operand.** `LEA EAX,[EAX + ECX*0x1 + 0x2c]` addresses
  `this + 80n + 0x2c` with the object in the **index** slot at scale 1 and the scaled offset in the
  base. A scan requiring `base == this` misses the array entirely.

Both belong in any tool that reads indexed accesses, on any compiler that strength-reduces
multiplies — which is all of them at `-O1` and above.

## A DEGENERATE CASE THAT SATISFIES EVERY RULE IS STILL WRONG

Five of eleven first-run rows were "arrays" one element long — a scalar that happened to be
addressed through an index, from a loop that runs once or an index the tracker cannot see is zero.
The clearest: a 4-byte class whose only member is its vptr, reported as an array of one because its
vector destructor indexes the object itself.

Every rule was satisfied. The rows were still false, they would have claimed members that do not
exist, and they overlapped rows another witness already had. **Add the degeneracy check — n ≥ 2, a
span wider than one stride, a set of more than one element — and count the refusals.** It costs one
comparison and it is the difference between a witness and a noise source.

## THE CONSTANT THE CODE ALREADY CONTAINS IS A SECOND WITNESS, FOR FREE

A bounded loop over a fixed-size array compares its index against the capacity as an immediate:
`CMP EAX,0x40` above one store, `CMP ECX,0x9` above another. That number owes nothing to whatever
arithmetic the tool used to derive the extent, so where both exist they are **two independent
witnesses** — and a disagreement is a defect in one of them rather than a judgement call, so it
should refuse the row rather than pick a side.

Two of six capacities corroborated that way, zero disagreements. **Before deriving a quantity a
second way, look for the one the binary already spells out.**

## A REACH CEILING AND A REACH MEASUREMENT ARE DIFFERENT NUMBERS, AND THE CHEAP ONE IS THE CEILING

Pricing a witness before building it asked *"do this population's bodies contain the instruction
shape at all?"* — 74% of the classes, holding 95% of the bytes in question. The finished tool asks
*"is the access through the object, with a resolvable multiplier?"* — **6.0% of classes**. A
twelfth of the estimate.

Both numbers are correct about their own question, and the cheap one is worth five minutes before
building: it is the right way to decide whether to build at all. It is the wrong number to report
afterwards, and the gap between the two is not a defect — it is what the tool's own rules cost,
which is exactly what the reach line above the results is for.

## AN UNCOVERED DENOMINATOR IS WHAT THE ARTIFACTS DO NOT COVER, NOT WHAT NOBODY HAS LOOKED AT

A coverage denominator is computed over the project's own evidence files, so a class reported as
`0% covered` means *"no artifact records these bytes"* — which reads as *"nobody has looked"* and
need not be. Measured: the class holding **27% of a project's entire remaining layout gap** had its
layout read, decided and applied to the program **three rounds earlier**. The decompiler was
already spelling the missing member by name. The round queued against it had been priced as *"the
gap is a different shape and needs a different witness"*, and the whole of it was one absent row in
one CSV.

The test costs one command, and it belongs before any witness is designed for a class's uncovered
bytes: **ask the database what it already calls them.** Read the class's own constructor and
destructor out of the exported decompilation and look at the member names. Applying a type is what
makes a population sweepable — and it is also what makes a previous round's reading invisible to a
denominator computed from files, because the program and the files are different stores.

The general shape, worth checking on any project with both: **a derived number computed from
artifacts cannot see anything that lives only in the database.** State the gap as *"no artifact
records"*, never as *"unknown"*, so the next reader is not told the wrong thing by the column name.

## A REFUSAL DOCUMENTED WITH ITS REASON IS A QUEUED ROUND WITH NO OWNER UNTIL SOMEBODY PRICES IT

The applier that made those decisions is exemplary about the refusal it walked into: its header
names the two lines of the library that reject its classes, quotes both messages, and carries a
standing assertion that the channel *still* refuses them — so the day the rule changes, the script
fires and says the record must move. None of that got the repair scheduled. What did was one
arithmetic run: **+1640 bytes, 39.9% of the remaining gap.**

A documented limitation competes for a round only once it carries a denominator. **Write the price
beside the reason**, or the reason is the only half anyone reads — and a reason, however careful,
sorts to the bottom of every queue against an item with a number on it.

## A LINEAR `this` TRACKER OVER A *BACKWARD* LOOP RECORDS THE LAST ELEMENT, NOT THE FIRST

A tracker that carries the object pointer linearly through a body records first-iteration offsets —
already a known trap. Its mirror image is not: a destructor that unwinds an array **downward** from
one-past-the-end (`LEA ESI,[obj + sizeof]` … `SUB ESI,stride`) makes the first iteration the *last*
element, so the harvested offsets land near the top of the object.

Measured on one class: twelve identical 104-byte records, the constructor-side rows clustered at
element 0 and the destructor-side rows clustered at element 11, and 22 harvested rows reading as 22
distinct fields covering 144 bytes of 1264. **The signature is two tight clusters of offsets, far
apart, whose intra-cluster spacing matches.** Where that appears, suspect one array rather than two
regions — and note the rows are not wrong, they are *aliases of each other* that the artifact has no
way to say so.

## WIDENING A CHANNEL IS ALSO A CHANGE TO EVERY CONSUMER THAT DEFERS TO IT

Pricing a repair against the denominator it moves is not pricing the repair. Measured: admitting
two classes to a layout channel landed exactly the predicted coverage, and four other consumers
changed with it -- a second layout producer that defers to the first dropped the class and its
one corroborated record; an attribution tool reopened a cell it had called decided; a structural
witness lost three pairs into a type no artifact sizes; and a serialisation check REFUSED, because
laying a class out byte-for-byte makes every serialised offset inside it checkable. The last one
turned an artifact-only round into a program mutation. List the READERS of every file the change
touches before scoping it, and expect the ones that defer ("skip classes already laid out") to
move in the opposite direction.

## RE-RUNNING EXCLUDED PRODUCERS FOR ATTRIBUTION FINDS STALE ARTIFACTS -- REGENERATE AT BOTH ENDS

A stability canary that excludes WSL-side or expensive producers never notices them drifting. The
cheap way to find out, and the only honest way to attribute a round's diff to that round: run the
producer at the pre-round commit and at the working tree. Identical output means any difference
from the committed file predates the round -- stale, not caused. Measured in one round: four
excluded artifacts stale, one with a failing self-calibration nobody had run. Revert what is not
yours, queue it with numbers, and do not fold it into the round's commit.

## AN ADDRESS-TAKEN BUFFER IS INVISIBLE TO EVERY FIELD-OFFSET WITNESS

Layout witnesses record a read or a write at `[this+K]`. A buffer the code reaches only by taking its
address -- `LEA reg,[this+K]` passed to a string routine, or `ADD reg,K` then a byte loop -- is
neither, so every such witness is silent and the bytes read as "no evidence". Measured: the largest
remaining gap holder in a class-layout denominator (512 bytes) was a text buffer two bodies used
through its address; its sibling classes had the same shape, and a sweep put an address-taken run
behind about 90% of that class family's uncovered bytes (an upper bound from instruction presence).
Look for it before calling a large uncovered region un-read. And note what a producer for it can and
cannot do: the address gives a buffer's START and its kind (string destination, block copy), never
its END -- that has to come from the allocation size, the next member the code addresses, or the
bound of what is copied in, and a width from the last of those is a floor.

## A HASHED-ONLY ARTIFACT IS ONE NOBODY WILL SEE GO STALE

A stability check that regenerates some artifacts and only hashes the rest cannot notice the rest
drifting from their inputs. Measured in one audit: of the hashed-only artifacts that are DERIVED
(not hand-written, ledgers or snapshots), about a third were stale or their producers could no longer
run; every stale one reproduced exactly at the commit that last wrote it (input drift, not
nondeterminism); one was stale in the very commit that wrote it; one had silently started reading
user data outside the project; and stale hashed-only data fed producers the check DOES regenerate,
where the comparison passes on both sides. Classify the excluded set into "never regenerated by
design" and "derived", and run the derived half on a schedule, normalising version stamps and line
endings, or it is not covered at all.

## A POPULATION KEYED ON THE PROPERTY A REPAIR PRODUCES CANNOT CONTAIN THE ROWS THAT NEED IT

A signature-repair sweep was keyed on functions whose namespace names a class, then made
`__fastcall(param_1)` bodies `__thiscall` with a typed `this`. Unnamed virtual bodies in the global
namespace -- the ones with no class, i.e. exactly the ones whose `this` is untyped -- were never in
its population, so every census it produced was complete over a set that excluded the defect.
Measured at the round that noticed: of 1,767 vtable slot targets, 349 were not `__thiscall`; 183 of
the 249 later repaired were unnamed functions in the global namespace. Re-key the population on a property the defect does not change
(here: membership in a vtable, read by table address).

The same shape in reverse degrades an instrument silently: a checker keyed its typed-slot population
on per-component type-history rows, and a newly CREATED struct has none -- 3,545 typed slots in 27
new structs were outside its reach the moment they existed. Only its both-directions join noticed.
