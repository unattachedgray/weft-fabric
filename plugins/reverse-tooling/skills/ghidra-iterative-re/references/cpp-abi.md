# C++ ABI reference: mangling, vtables, and modelling them in Ghidra

Lookup detail for C++ targets. `SKILL.md` carries the triggers — *establish the
inheritance model before relying on slot positions*, *check `ClassUtils` before
hand-rolling a vftable struct* — and this file is what you consult once one fires.

## MSVC mangled names

Shape for a **non-static member function**:

```
?<member>@<Class>@@ <access> <cv> <callconv> <return> <args> Z
```

classes innermost-first, so `?Foo@Inner@Outer@@...` is `Outer::Inner::Foo`.

**The `<cv>` character is easy to miss and its absence corrupts everything after it.**
`?Sleep@CGobject@@QAEXXZ` parses as `Q` (public non-virtual) `A` (cv-qualifier: none) `E`
(**`__thiscall`**) `X` `X` `Z` — *not* `Q` + `A`(=`__cdecl`). A parser written against a
grammar with no cv slot reads the cv byte as the calling convention and reports
`__cdecl` for **every `__thiscall` method in the binary**. Static members and free
functions have no `this` and so no cv byte.

Calling conventions (Ghidra's `MDCallingConvention`): `A`/`B` `__cdecl`, `C`/`D` `__pascal`,
**`E`/`F` `__thiscall`**, `G`/`H` `__stdcall`, `I`/`J` `__fastcall`.

The access character immediately after `@@` encodes access, virtualness **and staticness** —
the single most useful byte in the name. *(Full table from Ghidra's own
`MicrosoftDmang` source, `MDTypeInfoParser.java`. Earlier revisions of this file listed only
8 of the 13 rows, which silently mis-classified private/protected statics and had no entry
at all for adjustor thunks.)*

| Char | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `A` / `B` | private, non-virtual |
| `C` / `D` | private **static** |
| `E` / `F` | **private virtual** |
| `G` / `H` | private **adjustor thunk** |
| `I` / `J` | protected, non-virtual |
| `K` / `L` | protected **static** |
| `M` / `N` | **protected virtual** |
| `O` / `P` | protected **adjustor thunk** |
| `Q` / `R` | public, non-virtual |
| `S` / `T` | public **static** |
| `U` / `V` | **public virtual** |
| `W` / `X` | public **adjustor thunk** |
| `Y` / `Z` | free function (no class) |

**Data symbols have their own code, and it decides OWNERSHIP:** `0`/`1`/`2` =
private/protected/public **static class member**, **`3` = true global**, `4` = static local,
`5` = guard, `6` = vftable (or RTTI4), `7` = vbtable, `8` = RTTI. So `?pRendEng@@3PAV…` is a
global, while `?Table@CFoo@@2PAV…` is `CFoo`'s static member — and calling the second a
global is an ownership error of the same family as mis-attributing a field. Measured on one
binary: **50 class statics against 17 true globals**, i.e. the naive reading is wrong for
the majority.

**Vtable slots.** Under **single inheritance**, a function occupying a vtable slot carries a
virtual specifier (`E`/`F`/`M`/`N`/`U`/`V`), and a `Q` or `S` in a slot means your table is
not a vtable or your slot attribution is wrong. **Under multiple inheritance that rule is
false**: a secondary vtable's slot holds an **adjustor thunk** (`G`/`H`, `O`/`P`, `W`/`X`) —
a stub that fixes `this` by a fixed offset and jumps to the real override, e.g.
`sub ecx,8; jmp CDerived::Foo`, mangled `?Foo@CDerived@@W7AEXXZ`. So the rule holds only
given the inheritance-model test below, and a slot-index naming scheme run on an MI binary
would name the *stub* while the real override stayed anonymous.

**Adjustor-thunk absence is therefore a second, independent inheritance-model test.** A
census of access characters costs one pass: zero `G/H/O/P/W/X` corroborates single
inheritance from a different direction than "no `??_8`, no `??_9`", because under single
inheritance `this` never needs adjusting and there is nothing for a thunk to do. Measured on
one binary: 0 of 1094 mangled symbols — agreeing with the `??_8`/`??_9` zero.

### Special names (`??` prefix)

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `??0Class@@` | constructor |
| `??1Class@@` | destructor |
| `??2` / `??3` | `operator new` / `operator delete` |
| `??_7Class@@6B@` | **vftable** — its address IS the class's vtable, slot 0 |
| `??_7Derived@@6BBase@@@` | **secondary vftable** → multiple inheritance |
| `??_8Class@@7B@` | **vbtable** (virtual base table) → **virtual inheritance** |
| `??_9` | **vcall thunk** → MI dispatch adjustment |
| `??_B` | function-local static initialisation guard (**not** inheritance) |
| `??_C` | string literal |
| `??_D` | vbase destructor |
| `??_E` / `??_G` | vector / scalar deleting destructor — **MSVC puts `??_E` in the vtable**, Clang puts `??_G` (see the destructor trap below) |
| `??_F` | default-constructor closure |
| `??_H` / `??_I` | **vector constructor / destructor iterator** — the ABI's own witness that a member is an embedded **array**, and a far cheaper one than deriving element size from loop strides |
| `??_O` | copy-constructor closure |
| `??_S` | local vftable |
| `??_U` / `??_V` | `operator new[]` / `operator delete[]` — note an **array** allocation's size includes the count prefix, so it is not `n * sizeof(T)`; relevant wherever allocation size is used as a size bound |
| `??_R0`…`??_R4` | RTTI descriptors (absent when built `/GR-`) |

**`.?AV` is not only an RTTI signal.** MSVC emits `_TypeDescriptor` records for types named
in `catch` and `throw` **independently of `/GR`**. So a measured zero says *neither
polymorphic RTTI nor typed C++ EH* — a stronger finding than "no RTTI" — and `.?AV` present
in a `/GR-` build is exception data, whose surrounding structures are `FuncInfo`, not
`??_R0`. That `FuncInfo` is itself worth harvesting: its unwind map **names a destructor per
stack object with that object's frame offset**, and its try/catch map names caught types.

**Inheritance-model test.** Only unqualified `??_7Class@@6B@` forms present, with **no
`??_8` and no `??_9`**, is positive evidence of a plain single-inheritance chain — the
precondition for any slot-index reasoning.

### The destructor trap, learned the hard way

**A virtual destructor's vtable slot holds a compiler-generated *deleting destructor*
thunk, not `~Class` itself.** So `~Class` never appearing as a raw vtable target is
*expected ABI behaviour, not a scan gap*. In this project a mangled-vs-vtable cross-check
scored 188/199, and every one of the 11 misses was this. Budget for it before concluding a
sweep is incomplete.

**For MSVC the slot holds the VECTOR deleting destructor (`??_E`), not the scalar one.**
This reference previously asserted `??_G`; that is wrong for MSVC and the error is worth
understanding, because it is the single most likely thing to mislead you here:

> *"MSVC's virtual tables always contain a pointer to the vector deleting destructor for
> classes with virtual destructors … because clang always puts a pointer to a scalar
> deleting destructor to the vtable."* — [LLVM PR #170337](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/170337)

So **the two toolchains genuinely differ**, and "the slot holds `??_G`" is true of
Clang/Itanium-style output and false of MSVC. Check which compiler produced your binary
before trusting either statement.

The flags parameter, which is how you identify the form from a decompiled body
([Chen](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040203-00/?p=40763),
[Shilon](https://ofekshilon.com/2014/06/09/on-vector-deleting-destructors-and-some-newdelete-internals/)):

| Test | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `flags & 1` | also free the memory |
| `flags & 2` | destroying an **array**; otherwise a single object |

The element count is *"hidden in front of the vector"* — stored immediately before the
array, which is why the array branch reads it from `*(this - 4)` on 32-bit.

**One function serves both roles**: the vector deleting destructor behaves as a scalar one
when `flags & 2 == 0`, so the presence of the `& 2` branch identifies the *generated form*,
not what a particular call site does. (Shilon notes he has *"never seen a vector deleting
destructor called with flags different from 3"* in practice.)

Confirmed on one 1999 MSVC binary: all nine anchored classes' slot-38 targets carry the
`& 2` array branch with per-class strides (0x38, 0x2a8, 0x578, …) — consistent with the
rule above. Note the binary exported **no `??_E` or `??_G` symbol at all** (only `??_7` and
`??_B`), so it could not adjudicate its own naming; the identification came from the body
shape plus the documented MSVC rule, not from a symbol.

**The converse trap, and it bites when you go looking for the SCALAR destructor.** There are
**two** destructor bodies per polymorphic class, and the obvious way to recognise either one
recognises *both*: the scalar `~X` and the vector deleting destructor **both install the
class vptr into `[this+0]`, and both call the base-class destructor.** A recovery rule built
from "installs this class's vptr, then calls an ancestor's destructor" is therefore
structurally unable to separate them, and it will confidently hand you the deleting
destructor under the name `~X`.

Measured: a program-wide sweep for scalar destructors proposed `CRobotPart::~CRobotPart` for
a body that was in fact the slot-38 **deleting** destructor of a *different* (unnamed) class —
wrong class and wrong kind — and it was caught only because that name had been correctly
applied to another address one round earlier. The discriminator costs one predicate and was
already known from the deleting-destructor work above:

> a body carrying the **`flags & 1` test** *and* a **call to `operator delete`** is the
> DELETING destructor; the scalar one has neither.

Two general points fall out of that incident. **When a rule targets a shape, enumerate the
other populations that share the shape and encode the exclusion**, rather than waiting for a
collision to reveal it — here the exclusion already existed in a sibling round's applier and
simply had not been carried across. And **put the discriminator in the probe that first
proposes the answer, not only in the applier that would refuse it**: a pricing probe's output
is read, quoted and scoped against long before any applier sees it.

### Comparing names — the string-space trap

Raw mangled names (`?Sleep@CGobject@@QAEXXZ`) and Ghidra's demangled short names (`Sleep`)
are **different string spaces that never intersect**. A check comparing one against the
other reports 0/N forever and reads as a failing sweep rather than a broken test. Convert
first. Likewise `Function.getName()` is unqualified while `getName(True)` includes the
namespace.

**And there is a THIRD string space, which is the one that bites after you start applying
names: QUALIFIED versus BARE.** `Function.getName()` is unqualified, `getName(True)` includes the
namespace, and any check written as an anchored prefix test — `^FUN_`, `startswith("DAT_")`,
`name.startswith(placeholder_prefixes)` — is **correct on one of those and silently wrong on the
other.** `CRT::FUN_004ce523` is Ghidra's own placeholder wearing a real namespace, and `^FUN_` does
not match it.

The trap is that such a test is usually *written correct*. Early on, every name a harvester sees is
bare, so the anchor is right. Then a round puts functions into namespaces — which is exactly what a
successful C++ recovery does — and the same line starts answering *"yes, that has a ground-truth
name."* Measured on one project: 17 functions acquired a namespace with a placeholder leaf, and a
census offered 146 citations of the form `call_to_named : 0x004ce523=CRT::FUN_004ce523` to
delegated readers as ground truth. Nothing failed; the population that made the rule wrong was one
the pipeline itself created.

Two things follow, and the second is the useful one:

- **Ask the LEAF.** Split on the last `::` before testing a prefix. Put it in one shared function,
  and let the *prefix set* stay a parameter — call sites legitimately differ — so that the part
  which must never differ is the part with no choice in it.
- **When a checker and a producer disagree, ask what SHAPE each is reading before deciding which is
  wrong.** In that incident the citation *verifier* carried the identical anchored regex and was
  **correct**, because it asked the unqualified name. The same regex in two files, right in one and
  wrong in the other — and the disagreement was the only signal either one gave.

Ghidra 12.1 added Microsoft demangler **output options** controlling user-defined-type tags
(`struct` etc. in argument positions) and anonymous-namespace presentation
(`_anon_ABCD01234` vs the generic form). Both affect whether demangled and non-demangled
symbols land in the same namespace, so they affect name-based joins.

## When the binary is not open: `scripts/msvc_demangle`

The demangler you normally reach for lives inside the disassembler, so a binary you have
not imported cannot have its symbols read at all. That bites exactly where an export table
is most valuable — a companion DLL, a plugin, a demo build, a patched executable — and
`c++filt` is no help, since it decodes the Itanium ABI and MSVC's scheme is unrelated.

**This skill ships one executable**, `scripts/msvc_demangle`, for that case. It decodes a
name into class, member, access, static/virtual, calling convention, return type and
parameters; `--pe FILE` walks a PE export table directly, `--pe-imports FILE` the import
table; `--tsv` emits rows to join against other evidence. It is plain Python with no dependencies, so it runs anywhere the
skill is installed.

Measured on a 236 KB renderer DLL that had never been imported: **112 mangled exports, 4
`??_7` vftable anchors and 88 fully typed methods**, against 14 anchors in the whole of the
main executable that project had spent months on. The DLL also carried a CodeView debug
directory naming its build-time `.pdb` path — i.e. the source tree layout — which is free
and needs no import either.

### Never regex a mangled name for the types it mentions — ask the decoder

The types in a signature are the second-largest free-evidence source in a stripped C++
binary, and the tempting way to get at them is one line: `[UV]([A-Za-z_]\w*)@@` over the
raw string, since `V` introduces a class and `U` a struct. **It does not work, and it fails
in the direction that looks like success.** `U` is also the access character of a *public
virtual* member, so

```
?ToolbarCommand@CMessage@@UAEHPAVCToolBarButton@@@Z
                          ^ this U is "public virtual", not "struct"
```

matches at `UAEH…` and yields `AEHPAVCToolBarButton`. Worse, `re.finditer` does not
overlap, so having swallowed the `@@` the scan resumes *past* the real `CToolBarButton`
and never sees it at all. Measured on one 1999 MSVC/x86 binary's 979 exported names: **47
of the regex's 89 tokens were parse garbage and 31 real type names were lost** — including
five classes of one GUI family that a naming round was blocked on, and every `V0@@`-style
back-reference, which a regex cannot resolve by construction.

Both halves matter and only one is loud. The garbage is *admitted* by whatever the tokens
feed, and 47 nonsense namespaces nobody will ever propose are harmless. The 31 losses are
silent: a gate that refuses real evidence is indistinguishable from a gate working. That
asymmetry is why this survived two rounds of review with a comment beside it naming the
expensive direction.

**The same rule bites a CAREFUL regex, and there the failure is a confident wrong answer
rather than garbage.** A later sweep — hunting pointee types named in artifact *prose*, where
no decoder can be asked because the text is not a symbol — narrowed the pattern properly to
the pointer/reference introducers and anchored it on a word boundary:
`\b(?:PAV|ABV|AAV|PBV)([A-Za-z0-9_]+)@`. **A mangled type code sits INSIDE one unbroken
token, so a leading `\b` can never match one.** In

```
?SetPosition@CMover@@UAEXABVCLVector@@@Z
                        ^ the ABV is preceded by X -- no word boundary, no match
??0CMover@@QAE@ABV0@@Z
                ^ this ABV DOES follow an @, so the back-reference matches
```

the scan silently skipped the real pointee and reported **`0`** — the numeric
back-reference — as the type of the one cell the sweep existed to settle, and its strong
bucket read 2 rows where it held 8. The `\b` habit is imported from ordinary word matching,
where it is right, and it is wrong here by construction; so is admitting a digit as a class
name. Where the text genuinely is a symbol, ask the decoder as above. Where it is prose and
you must match, **anchor on nothing, require the pointee to start with a letter, and pin
both in a test** — the failure mode is not noise you would notice but an answer you would
believe.

`msvc_demangle` exposes the decoded set as `Symbol.udts` (and a `udts` column in `--tsv`)
so the correct thing is not more work than the regex.

**And a decoder that reports a symbol's KIND but not its type has a hole you cannot see
from its output.** The same tool decoded all 979 names without error while silently
dropping the type of every *data* symbol — MSVC puts a storage class (`0`–`5`) where a
function puts its access character, and the parser stopped there. 57 of 979 exports are
data, and six real classes in that binary (`CInputDevice`, `CMoverCreator`, `CRendEng`,
`CRendPalette`, `CSoundSystem`, `CWorld`) are named by the export table **only** as the
pointee type of a global. Every field the decoder did fill in was right; the absent one
read as *"this symbol has no type"* rather than as *"nobody parsed it"*. A second decoder
found it in one comparison — see the two-tier self-test below.

### Read the IMPORT table too, not just the exports

An export table says what a binary offers; an **import** table says what it actually uses
of someone else's — a far smaller and more pointed set. Measured on a renderer DLL that
links against its host executable: the export table gave 112 names, and the *import* table
gave the complete host-to-plugin contract in **48 symbols**, including a `??_7` vftable
(so the plugin's classes derive from a base in the host), the host's name-hash function,
and sixteen globals the plugin reads directly. That is a reimplementation boundary you can
hold in your head, and it was free.

The reciprocal is worth remembering: when a companion binary imports mangled names from
the main one, **those imports are a priority list** for the main binary's exports. You now
know which of its several hundred exported symbols another shipped component depends on.

### Its self-test is two tiers, and each caught what the other could not

This matters beyond this one tool, because **a decoder's output is the kind of result that
looks right while being wrong** — see *A decoder bug is invisible from its own output*
below. The two tiers are:

- **vectors** — one name per code path, committed with the tool, always run. This *pins*
  the decoder against regressions. It cannot *validate* it: a vector written from the same
  misreading as the code agrees with the code.
- **`--oracle DIR`** — a project holding `symbols/exports.csv` (mangled names with their
  expected class, member and static/virtual flags) and optionally a column of a real
  demangler's return types. This *corroborates*, because the expected values came from
  somewhere else entirely.

Both have caught a bug the other was blind to. The oracle found MSVC's **second
back-reference table** — the one for composite argument types, unrelated to the name table
— missing, along with pointer-to-member-function. The vectors found that **every
constructor argument was being silently dropped**: a constructor has no return type, a bare
`@` stands where one would be, and consuming that `@` as an empty parameter list produces
`C::C()` for `??0C@@QAE@ABV0@@Z`. An oracle comparing only names, flags and return types
cannot see that, and this one did not.

**And write the operator table from a reference, not from memory.** Two entries were wrong
on the first pass — `?P` is `operator>=`, not `operator=`; `?V` is `operator&&`, not
`operator|` — and neither ground truth exercised either code, so only re-deriving the table
against the published scheme caught them. A transcribed table is a hypothesis.

## The demangler is a TYPE witness, not just a name witness

A mangled symbol encodes the **full signature** — return type, parameter types, `const`,
calling convention. Most projects use it for the name and throw the rest away. That is the
single largest free-evidence source in a stripped C++ binary after the vtables, and it is
worth being precise about what tier it carries, because the honest answer is not the obvious
one.

**The tier is a property of AGREEMENT, not of "the demangler".**

| situation | tier | what to do |
|---|---|---|
| the mangled string is in the binary, and **two independent decoders agree** | **ground-truth-adjacent** — the compiler wrote this down and you recovered it twice | cite it |
| the two decoders **disagree** | a **finding**, never an average | stop; one decoder is broken, find out which |
| only one decoder resolves it | a **clue** | record it, do not cite it |
| the mangled string is one **you** synthesised | worthless | you are reading your own inference back |

The reasoning: the mangled string is bytes in the file, so it is ground truth. The decoding
is not an inference, it is a **parse against a published grammar** — and a parse can be
wrong in a *checkable* way, which a guess cannot. Your disassembler ships a demangler that is
an **independent implementation of that same grammar**, so you already have a second decoder.
Use it as one.

Measured on one 1999 MSVC/x86 binary: **979 mangled exports, 669 comparable, 669 agree, 0
disagree.** A zero there is what promotes the whole channel from clue to evidence — and the
check costs one sweep.

**Report DISAGREEMENTS as the headline, never a match percentage.** A 98% match rate with the
2% hidden is exactly how a decoder bug survives: see below, where a parser was wrong about
13.9% of a binary's functions and nothing in its output looked wrong.

### Field types from accessor return types

The highest-value derived use. An exported accessor whose body is a **single load from
`this`** declares the type of the field it returns:

```
?GetTotalMetajoulesUsed@CStructure@@UAEMXZ   ->   FLD [ECX+0x468]   ->   +0x468 is float
                                     ^ M = float, the compiler's own statement
```

This is a different *kind* of witness from everything else in a layout toolkit: every other
field-type route reads **instructions** and infers (x87 vs integer opcodes, scaled-index
widths, copy extents); this one reads a **declaration**. On the same binary it typed **43
fields across 9 classes**, of which **35 corroborated an already-decided type, 3 contradicted
one, and 5 were new**. All three contradictions were real findings — including a field the
project had recorded as `float` that the binary declares `int`, and a `float` hiding inside a
20-byte blob nobody had resolved.

**Two structural requirements, both learned by getting it wrong first:**

1. **Zero parameters** — the mangling must end `XZ` (MSVC) / `v` (Itanium). A function taking
   an argument may return anything computed from it, so its return type says nothing about a
   field. Without this, four `CCamera` coordinate-transform functions all "declared" the same
   offset.
2. **A real memory operand** — require the operand to carry *both* a register and a
   displacement. Without this, `MOV EAX,1` in a `return true;` stub reads as a load from
   `+0x1`, and you get a confident field type at an offset that is not a field.

Both false positives looked entirely plausible in a summary and were obvious in a full
listing. **Print the promoted population in full.**

### CLASS names from a virtual's declared return type — `return this` is an identification

The same declaration channel names **classes**, not just fields, and it reaches classes that
own no exported method and appear in no string — exactly the population an ownership-based
census reports as unnameable.

The shape: a base class's exported virtual declares a *class* in its return or parameter
types. A derived class overrides that slot with `MOV EAX,ECX; RET n` — `return this`. The
override is then a compiler-checked statement that **this class is that type**, or derives
from it.

```
base slot 20  ?GetSkeleton@CRendResource@@UAEPAVCRendDynamicSkeleton@@PAVCRender@@@Z
                                              ^ the return type names a class
one derived vtable overrides slot 20 with     MOV EAX,ECX ; RET 4     ("return this")
  ->  that vtable IS CRendDynamicSkeleton
```

Measured on a 1999 MSVC renderer DLL: of the **23** vtables with ≥31 slots, **exactly one**
overrode that slot, and its body was `return this`. The class had survived three earlier
rounds as *"an unnamed class"* — found by a store scan, placed on its own branch by slot
similarity, and never named.

**Why this is worth a rule.** An earlier round on the same binary had *measured* a naming
ceiling — "roughly 17 of ~40 vtables cannot be named from this file" — and the measurement was
sound for the route it tested (a class is named by the exported methods appearing **in** its
table). Stated as a property of the binary, it was wrong: the information was in the export
table all along, in the **signatures** rather than in the ownership. **A ceiling measured
against one route is a fact about the route.** Say which route.

Three cautions:

- `return this` bounds the identification from **below**: the class is that type *or derives
  from it*. Say so, and check whether any other vtable could be a further derivation.
- Uniqueness is the strength of the claim. *"Exactly one of 23 overrides this slot"* is an
  identification; "one of the ones I looked at" is a guess. Enumerate the population.
- The same handle exists in **parameter** types, and in the types of exported data symbols.
  A sweep is cheap: every exported virtual signature mentioning a class type you cannot yet
  place is a candidate, and the corroboration is a one-instruction body.

**A SLOT INDEX IS MEANINGLESS WITHOUT ITS BASE — this is what turns the route into a false-positive
machine.** Slot 1 is `OnAttach` under one root and `GetAnimator` under another. Sweeping "slot 1"
across every table in the same binary named *every* table as *both* classes: 22 rows, each one
carrying a real address, a real body and a real mangled name, and each one wrong. So an anchor
applies only to tables that **derive from the anchor's declaring class**, and you need a derivation
test before you have a naming.

Two consequences the measured case forced:

- **The cheap test is "T inherits at least half of B's slots unchanged", and it has no power
  against a small base.** A 3-slot base gives you a coin flip. Set a floor (≥8 slots worked here),
  and report what falls below it as **UNCONFIRMED** rather than dropping it — the residue was one
  table, which is a backlog item, whereas silence would have looked like completeness.
- **Anchor on the EXPORT where you can, not on the slot.** If the function that allocates and
  returns the object is itself an exported name, its identity is ground truth and no derivation
  test is needed at all. That is the strongest form of route B, and it is the one naming that
  survived the filter here.

**And refuse the multi-allocation body.** A function that stores two vtables does not say which
object it returns. Refuse it, print both candidates, and let another call site settle it — in the
measured case a second, single-store function named the same table an hour later.

### This generalises past MSVC

The mechanism is "the ABI encodes types in the symbol", which is true of every scheme that
mangles overloads:

- **Itanium C++ ABI** (GCC, Clang, and most non-Windows targets): `_Z` names encode
  parameter types with the same one-letter vocabulary — `i` int, `f` float, `d` double, `j`
  unsigned int, `v` void, `P` pointer, `K` const. **Return types are encoded only for
  function templates**, so the accessor route above is weaker there: you get parameter types
  for free and must recover returns another way. Setters, not getters, are the productive
  half.
- **CodeWarrior** (GameCube/Wii, PS2-era): its own scheme, and neither shipped demangler
  decodes it — see the platform notes. If names look mangled and decode under nothing, that
  is the likely cause.
- **Borland/Watcom**: their own schemes again, with their own tooling.

The rule to carry across all of them: **decode with two implementations and treat the
disagreement set as the product.**

### A decoder bug is invisible from its own output

Measured, and the reason this section exists. A project's hand-rolled MSVC parser used a
**fixed index** for the return type — correct for instance members, wrong for static members
and free functions, which have no `cv` slot and so sit one byte earlier. **126 of 905
exported functions, 13.9%, were mis-read for the life of the project.**

It was undetectable from the output because **a wrong letter is still a plausible answer**:
`??3CGobject@@SAXPAX@Z` yielded `P`, the first byte of the parameter `PAX`, which reads as
"returns a pointer" rather than as "you indexed the wrong slot". The same fixed index also
walked into **data symbols**, which have no return slot at all, and produced the third letter
of a *type name* as a type code.

Two things catch this class of bug, and neither is code review:

- **Census the alphabet.** Ask "which characters appear in this slot across every symbol in
  the binary", and read the list. Codes no type should ever be are the tell — it is how both
  bugs above surfaced, in one query.
- **A lookup must not return the same value for "absent" and "undeterminable".** The same
  parser's primitive table was missing one code entirely; the lookup returned `None`, every
  consumer read `None` as "this cell has no determinable type", and two fields sat
  unprovable for months that the binary plainly typed. Distinguish the two, or the gap is
  unauditable.

**And check whether your own documentation already said so.** The cv-slot rule was written
in this very file, correctly, while the parser three directories away violated it. A rule
recorded is not a rule applied.

## Itanium ABI (GCC/Clang — Linux, most consoles' modern toolchains)

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `_Z...` | mangled function |
| `_ZTV<class>` | vtable |
| `_ZTI` / `_ZTS` | typeinfo / typeinfo name |
| `_ZTT` | VTT — **virtual inheritance present** |
| `_ZThn...` / `_ZTv...` | non-virtual / virtual adjustor thunks → **multiple inheritance** |
| `_ZGV` | guard variable |

Itanium vtables carry an offset-to-top and RTTI pointer *before* slot 0, so the symbol
address is not the first function pointer — unlike MSVC. Account for the header before
computing slot indices.

## Other toolchain families — do not assume MSVC or Itanium

The two schemes above cover Windows and most Unix/modern-console targets, but not the
console era this skill also targets:

- **Metrowerks CodeWarrior** — the dominant compiler for **GameCube, Wii**, and a large
  share of **PS2** titles, plus older Mac. Its C++ mangling is its own scheme, broadly
  `name__<qualifiers><argtypes>` with `F` introducing the argument list and `__` separating
  the member name from its class — e.g. `foo__3BarFi` for `Bar::foo(int)`. Ghidra's MSVC and
  Itanium demanglers will **not** decode it, so mangled names may pass through unrecognised
  and read as opaque garbage rather than as symbols. Its vtable and RTTI layout also differ.
  If mangled-looking names in a GameCube/Wii/PS2 binary decode under neither shipped
  demangler, suspect CodeWarrior before concluding the names are stripped.
- **Watcom** — DOS-era games. Its own mangling, and `__watcall` register-based calling
  conventions that differ from every convention listed under x86 elsewhere.
- **Borland / Turbo C++** — DOS/early-Windows era, another distinct scheme.

Practical consequence: **identify the compiler before interpreting symbols or calling
conventions.** Rich data ("Rich header") in a PE, linker version fields, CRT banners, and the
shape of function prologues all help. Getting this wrong makes every symbol look absent and
every argument look misplaced.

## Modelling a C++ class in Ghidra

### Use `ClassUtils` — it is a convention, not a helper bag

`ghidra.program.model.gclass.ClassUtils` / `ClassID`:

```python
ClassUtils.isVTable(dataType)
ClassUtils.getVftDefaultEntry(dtm) / getVftEntrySize(dtm)     # vftable slot type/size
ClassUtils.getVbtDefaultEntry(dtm) / getVbtEntrySize(dtm)     # virtual BASE table
ClassUtils.getClassPath(classId)
ClassUtils.getClassInternalsPath(composite)   # category path for "class internals"
ClassUtils.getSelfBaseType(composite)
ClassUtils.getBaseClassDataTypePath(composite)
ClassUtils.getReplacementPointers(dtm, structure)
ClassUtils.getReplacementType(structure)
ClassUtils.hasClassAttribute(structure)
ClassUtils.createVxTableDescriptionOffsetTag(ptrOffsetInClass)
ClassUtils.validateVtableDescriptionOffsetTag(description)
```

Following these keeps recovered classes interoperable with Ghidra's PDB and RTTI
machinery. Hand-rolled structs sit parallel to it and cannot be consumed by it.

Related: `SymbolTable.createClass(parent, name, sourceType)` creates a `GhidraClass`, which
Ghidra auto-associates with a struct of the same name.

### Getting virtual method names into the decompiler

Ghidra's official recipe (from `improvingDisassemblyAndDecompilation.pdf`):

1. Create a **`FunctionDefinitionDataType`** per virtual method, calling convention
   `__thiscall` — **with `this` as an explicit first parameter.** A function definition has no
   class to supply one, so a definition built from a method's signature minus `this` puts the
   first real parameter in ECX and under-states the callee's stack cleanup at every call site:
   silently wrong C (measured, and the fix check, in `applying-changes.md`, "Type vftable
   struct components").
2. Create a **`<Class>_vftable` structure** whose fields are those function definitions
   **in slot order**, each field **named** after its method.
3. Make the **class struct's first field a pointer** to that vftable struct.
4. Then `Auto Fill in Structure` on a known `this` fills remaining fields from access
   patterns.

Shortcut for finding the tables in the first place: `Search → For Address Tables`, then
apply the definitions to the pointers and `Data → Create Structure`.

### Devirtualization — three explicit mechanisms

Ghidra does **not** devirtualize automatically; it cannot prove a vtable pointer is
constant after assignment (issues #650, #516). Escalating:

1. **Name the slots** — the recipe above. Yields `this->vtable->Method(...)` rendering.
2. **Mark the vtable data `CONSTANT`** (`MutabilitySettingsDefinition`: `NORMAL`,
   `CONSTANT`, `VOLATILE`, `WRITABLE`; per-data via Settings or per-block via Memory Map).
   *The decompiler shows the contents of constant memory rather than a pointer to it* —
   which is what lets it read through the table. `.rdata` genuinely is read-only, so this
   is factually correct rather than a hack.
3. **Override the call site** — add a primary reference of type
   `RefType.CALL_OVERRIDE_UNCONDITIONAL` at the indirect call (relatives:
   `JUMP_OVERRIDE_UNCONDITIONAL`, `CALLOTHER_OVERRIDE_CALL/JUMP`). Converts it to a direct
   call. Ghidra 12.1 did something equivalent for Objective-C — `WhatsNew.md` states that
   `_objc_msgSend` calls "have been overridden to reference the actual target method (if
   discoverable)" — though it does not name the mechanism, so treat the specific `RefType`
   attribution as inference, not documented fact.

**Only mechanism 3 changes what the call *is*.** Mechanisms 1 and 2 make the table and its
slots legible; the call site stays indirect and no call-graph edge appears. If you need
readable decompilation, 1 and 2 suffice. If you need call-graph edges — call trees,
reachability, "who can invoke this" — you need 3, per site.

**Mechanism 3 writes your inference into the call graph.** Tag it `SourceType.AI`, record it
as an assertion, and never let a harvest read it back as fact.

## Slot-index correspondence — free names, under one precondition

Under single inheritance, a derived class's vtable is its base's slot sequence with
overrides substituted in place and new virtuals appended. Therefore: **if a base table's
slot *i* holds a named exported virtual, and a derived table's slot *i* holds `FUN_xxxx`,
that function is the override of that method** — name it `Derived::Method`. This is ABI
mechanics, not inference.

Preconditions, all of which must be checked, not assumed:

- **The two tables are in an ANCESTOR–DESCENDANT relation, and the slot index lies within
  the ancestor's table.** This is the precondition that gets dropped, because "slot *i* in
  both tables" is trivially computable and the relationship is not. New virtuals are
  *appended*, so every branch of a hierarchy starts numbering its own additions at the same
  index — two classes in **sibling** branches are therefore **guaranteed** to hold unrelated
  methods at the same slot, not merely likely to. Formally: slot *i* is comparable between
  classes A and B only if their nearest common ancestor's table has **more than *i***
  entries. Above that boundary the index carries no information at all.

  **Measured, on a 1999 MSVC/x86 game.** A round was scoped, priced and approved on the
  rule without this test, keyed on the hierarchy **root** and slot index — a key that looked
  conservative and was not, because **223 of 224 tables rooted at one class**, so "per
  hierarchy" was the global rule wearing a hat. It produced **111 candidate names; exactly
  1 survived** the ancestor-length test. The shape of the collision: the shared ancestor's
  table held 152 slots, one branch grew to 171 and another to 215, so every index past 152
  named two different methods depending on the branch — and two of the round's headline
  groups (14 candidates each) were a single 47-vs-53-slot collision counted twice. *Check
  the distribution of whatever you key on before trusting the key.*

  **Calibrate this on ground truth before trusting either direction, and note that the
  population you need contains no candidates at all**: take every PAIR of tables that
  carry a mangled export name at the same slot — both ends ground truth, no inference
  anywhere — and split by whether the slot is comparable between them. On the binary
  above: **1,957,540 comparable pairs agree and 0 disagree; 10,526 cross-branch pairs
  disagree and 0 agree.** The regimes separate *perfectly*, which is the useful shape of
  the result in both directions — off-branch the index is noise rather than a weak signal,
  and on-branch the propagation is confirmed nearly two million times over, which is a far
  better warrant for applying it than any candidate-level argument. Make that split an
  assertion that raises if either side empties or either regime stops separating.

  **The member NAME is not a safer key than the index — it is a worse one.** Reaching for
  the name when the index looks unsafe is the obvious move and it fails harder, because a
  name is not unique across a hierarchy at all. Measured on the same binary, over every
  exported vtable target: **20 of 239 exported member names span more than one slot** —
  `MoveTo` occupies **four** (7, 19, 179, 180) with four different signatures, and
  `GetMaxOffensiveRangeSq` is `float(int)` at slot 13 and `void(float&,float&)` at slot 14,
  so a name-keyed rule would hand a `void` member a float return. The index side of the
  same binary: **42 of 214 slot indices carry more than one distinct exported member**.
  Neither key establishes *same declared member* on its own; the pair (declaring class,
  slot) resolved through the hierarchy does, and it is worth CHECKING rather than assuming
  — ask whether a family's exported implementations name the same member, and refuse the
  family when they do not. On that binary 65 families held two or more exported
  implementations and **0 disagreed**, which is what licensed the rule; the check costs one
  join and is the only thing standing between it and the two failures above.

- **A virtual's RETURN TYPE is declared once, by the class that declares the member — so one
  exported implementation types the whole family.** MSVC mangled names carry the return type
  (`?GetToolbarInfo@CMessage@@UAEPAUCToolbarInfo@@XZ` → `CToolbarInfo *`), and every
  implementation of that slot implements that one declared member. This settles returns the
  decompiler left `undefined` at a tier no body-reading can reach: it is the binary's own
  declaration, not an inference. **The tier of the DONOR is the whole rule.** The same
  project had already asked the same question about PARAMETER types using a *sibling's
  decompiler-inferred* type as the donor and measured the family's typed siblings
  contradicting each other in **17 of 62 families** (`CLVector *` vs `float *` vs `int *` for
  one slot) — because a family of inferences is several independent guesses, not one fact
  repeated. Restricted to exported donors the same shape returned **447 of 484 agreements
  (92.4%) and 0 disagreeing families**. Two corollaries worth copying: take the Ghidra
  SPELLING of the type from the donor's own applied signature rather than mapping declared
  types to tool names by hand (a hand table mapped `unsigned long` to `uint` where that
  program spells it `ulong`), and exclude the exported implementations themselves from the
  agreement denominator — a declaration agreeing with itself is a tautology, and there can be
  many of them per slot.

  **And before pricing this route at all, check whether the project has already APPLIED
  it.** In the incident above the repo had shipped an applier using the correct
  ancestor-form rule 56 program versions earlier, carrying its own calibration in its
  header; the round that priced the loose rule had not read it. An applier is a rule plus
  its calibration plus the population it deliberately abstained from — a pricing probe
  written from scratch starts from none of those and can regress against all three.

- **A second witness that is blind to the hierarchy — on MSVC x86 the cheapest is the
  `RET imm16`.** `__thiscall` makes the callee pop its arguments, so the terminal return
  instruction's immediate **is** the argument byte count, straight from the instruction
  stream. In the incident above it refuted **60 of 108** readable candidates on its own,
  knowing nothing about tables or names, and passed the single survivor. Note the asymmetry
  before using it as confirmation: most virtuals take 0 or 1 argument, so *agreement* is
  what two unrelated functions do and only *disagreement* carries information.

- Single inheritance (the `??_8`/`??_9`/qualified-`??_7` test above).
- Correct slot alignment between the tables — join on **target addresses**, not demangled
  short names, since an override shares its base's name and makes different tables look
  identical.
- The base table must be complete; a table truncated by an undefined-function pointer
  shifts nothing but hides slots beyond the truncation.

  **A truncated table does not merely hide slots — it forges a depth, and depth is what
  ancestry arguments are built on.** Measured here: a 47-slot table was recorded as 42
  because slot 42's target had real instructions but no defined `Function`. At 42 it looked
  *shallower* than the 47-slot classes it actually equals, and a depth-ranking test
  therefore promoted it to a nearer ancestor of four classes — inverting the ancestry. At
  its true 47 it is not a candidate at all. Before any depth comparison, verify each
  table's extent independently of the sweep that produced it: walk past the recorded end
  and check whether code pointers continue, and where the incoming references actually fall.

## Recovering *which* class derives from which

The `??_8`/`??_9` test above establishes the inheritance **model** (single vs virtual vs
multiple). It does not tell you the **graph** — who derives from whom. Those are different
questions and the second one has a trap.

### Slot similarity ranks; it does not order

The tempting approach is to compare tables: a derived table shares its base's slot prefix,
so rank candidate bases by how many leading slot targets they share. That works as a
*tie-break* and fails as a *primary source*, because **similarity is symmetric and
inheritance is not**. Nothing in "these two tables share 43 slots" says which is the
parent. Depth is then used to supply the missing direction — and that is where it goes
wrong.

> **Never require the parent to be strictly shallower than the child.** A derived class
> that adds **no new virtuals** has *exactly* its base's slot count. The rule feels safe —
> it prevents sibling cycles — but it makes a same-depth parent **structurally ineligible**,
> so the ranking silently returns the *grandparent* and every check downstream agrees with
> it, because the grandparent really is an ancestor.
>
> Measured on one binary: three 47-slot classes were assigned to their 38-slot grandparent
> because their real parent was also 47 slots, differing only at its own destructor slot
> and one other. Nothing failed. The chain was self-consistent, passed a cycle check, and
> passed a 100%-agreement correspondence gate — the wrong answer is compatible with all of
> them, because an ancestor's slots correspond too.

### Constructors carry the direction

Use the binary's own construction order instead. A constructor builds its bases first, so
with the base constructor inlined it **stores each base's vftable into offset 0 of the
object in turn**, before storing its own:

> **{ classes whose `??0`/`??1` stores table V } == V's class + its descendants**

That relation is *directional*, comes from code plus exported symbols rather than from
shape comparison, and is cheap: find `MOV dword ptr [reg], <imm32 == V>` with no
displacement, take the containing function, and read its mangled name.

Combine them in the right order: **ancestry decides who is eligible, similarity picks the
nearest among them.** Then a same-depth parent is admitted naturally and no depth rule is
needed anywhere.

Caveats, both load-bearing:

- **It is a LOWER BOUND.** Inlining depth varies, so a missing pair proves nothing while a
  present pair is strong. Never read absence as evidence of non-ancestry.
- **A base's vftable store and a first-member-subobject store look identical** — both write
  a vftable to offset 0. Guard with the ABI invariant that a base is never *deeper* than
  its derived class, and treat a cycle in the relation as proof the detection is matching
  something else.

### Typing `this` from a call site — an UPPER BOUND on depth

Tempting shortcut, once some registers are typed: at a direct `CALL` whose `ECX` holds a
provably typed object, the callee's `this` is that type. It is the `__thiscall` contract
and it reaches non-exported bodies that have no signature of their own. **Measured on one
binary, it is wrong a third of the time**, and the failures are two recognisable shapes:

- **The caller holds a DERIVED pointer and calls an INHERITED method.** Inferred
  `CVehicle*`, declared `CBasicUnit*`; inferred `CStructure*`, declared `CBasicGobject*`.
  So an inferred receiver type is an **upper bound on depth** — the mirror of the
  lower-bound rule above, and the same direction problem as the destructor stride.
- **The callee is not `__thiscall` at all**, so `ECX` was never `this`: a private
  *static* member (`?F@C@@CA...`) inherited a caller's register type. Where the callee is
  exported you can filter this by convention — and where it is *not* exported, which is
  exactly the population the shortcut exists to reach, you cannot.

Two consequences. First, calibrate it before use: many inferred callees are themselves
exported and carry a mangled declaring class, so the inference can be checked against
ground truth for free (36 agreed, 18 disagreed — refuted). Second, the depth error is
survivable where the *offset* decides ownership: on a single-inheritance chain each
offset lies in exactly one class's own range, so attributing an access by offset rather
than by receiver type is correct even when the receiver is named too deep. Attribute
by offset; use the receiver only to pick the chain.

### How to tell you got it right

A corrected graph should make an *independent* measurement better, not just different.
Here, re-deriving raised the slot-correspondence sample count 89 → 107 while agreement
stayed at 100%: the new samples came from the newly-corrected edges, so wrong parentage
would have shown up as disagreement. Consistency proves little on its own; a rival
measurement improving is worth much more.

## Dispatch recovery — virtual calls are one case of several

*Moved here from `SKILL.md` in the 2026-08-23 restructure; the mechanics it points
at were already in this file.*

Do not force an OOP reading onto a program that isn't OOP. Era matters: pre-C++ and
early-C++ game code dispatches through plain function-pointer tables far more often than
through vtables, and the recovery mechanics are the same while the *semantics* are not.

**Establish the inheritance model before relying on slot positions.** A derived class's
vtable shares a prefix with its base only under single inheritance, so any naming or
ownership scheme built on slot index depends on it. For MSVC this is three cheap string
searches, not an assumption:

| Search | Meaning if found |
|---|---|
| `??_8` | **vbtable** — virtual inheritance is present; slot prefixes are not reliable |
| `??_9` | **vcall thunk** — multiple-inheritance dispatch adjustment |
| `??_7Derived@@6BBase@@@` (qualified form) | a **secondary** vftable, i.e. multiple inheritance |

Only the unqualified `??_7Class@@6B@` form appearing, with no `??_8` and no `??_9`,
is positive evidence of a plain single-inheritance chain. (Measured on one 1999 MSVC game
binary: 14 unqualified vftables, zero `??_8`, zero `??_9` — single inheritance confirmed
for every class carrying an exported vftable symbol, which is a floor for the rest.)
Itanium-ABI equivalents: `_ZTV` vtables, `_ZTT` VTT for virtual inheritance, `_ZThn`/`_ZTv`
thunks.

Shapes to expect, all of which look alike in `.rodata`:

- **C++ vtables** — one per class, slot order = declaration order, derived tables share a
  prefix with their base. Only these carry inheritance meaning.
- **State-machine / message-handler tables** — indexed by state or message enum. The
  index is a *grammar*, not a class.
- **Opcode / bytecode interpreter dispatch** — a table indexed by opcode. Recovering it
  recovers the scripting language; each handler names one instruction.
- **Callback registration structs** — `{name, fnptr, arity}` triples. Often self-naming.
- **Jump tables from switch statements** — Ghidra may fail to bound the switch variable;
  `FindUnrecoveredSwitchesScript.java` locates these and `SwitchOverride.java` fixes them.

A run-of-code-pointers heuristic cannot tell these apart. **Discriminate by how the table
is used**, not by its shape: a C++ vtable's address gets stored into offset 0 of an object
by a constructor; a dispatch table is indexed by a variable at a call site. Verify against
any authoritative naming (vftable symbols, RTTI) before believing an interpretation.

### If it *is* C++

Three things to know here; the mechanics are in **`references/cpp-abi.md`**.

- **`ClassUtils` exists** (`ghidra.program.model.gclass`) — Ghidra has a *convention* for
  modelling C++ classes with vtables, including virtual base tables. Follow it and your
  results interoperate with Ghidra's PDB/RTTI machinery; hand-roll and they sit parallel to
  it, unusable by it. **Check it before building any vftable struct by hand.**
- **Ghidra does not devirtualize automatically** — it cannot prove a vtable pointer is
  constant after assignment (issues #650, #516). But four explicit mechanisms do work,
  escalating: name the slots via a vftable struct, mark the table `CONSTANT` so the
  decompiler reads *through* it, run **`AddVfunctionCallRefScript`** (shipped in 12.1 —
  see the measured caveats below, they are severe), or override the call site with
  `RefType.CALL_OVERRIDE_UNCONDITIONAL`. The last two **write your inference into the call
  graph** — tag them `SourceType.AI` and never let a harvest read them back as fact.
- **`AddVfunctionCallRefScript`'s real preconditions, and why batching it is unsound.**
  An earlier revision of this document said its precondition was "a single corresponding
  applied vftable structure, so exactly the work the struct-apply rounds already did."
  **That is wrong, measured against a 12.1.2 install and a project that had done exactly
  that work.** Read the source before planning a round on it:
  - `isVftableStructure()` requires **every component to be a `Pointer` to a
    `FunctionDefinition`**. A struct built the idiomatic way — from
    `ClassUtils.getVftDefaultEntry(dtm)`, which returns a plain `PointerDataType` — fails
    this on every component. Measured: **0 of 15** applied vftable structs passed. Naming
    the *fields* after the methods does not help either; `getOrdinalOfFunction()` matches
    the decompiler token against the **pointed-to type's** name.
  - It is **cursor-driven** (`currentLocation instanceof DecompilerLocation`) — one call
    site per invocation. There is no batch mode to "run and count".
  - It writes `SourceType.**ANALYSIS**`, not `AI`. On a project that filters harvests by
    tier, that launders an inference into the trusted tier.
  - **The soundness is supplied by the human at the cursor, and automation removes it.**
    Its inference is *"type T is applied at exactly one address A, therefore slot k
    resolves to `*(A + 4k)`"* — which assumes **static type == dynamic type**. A
    `Base *` at runtime points at a *derived* class's table. The script never checks for
    descendants because an analyst looking at one site knows whether the receiver can be
    derived. Measured on one hierarchy: sound for 6 of 14 classes, and the 8 unsound ones
    were the interesting ones, carrying **748 of 1066** slots (one base had 16 descendants).
    A batch version would emit confidently wrong call-graph edges while every report
    counted them as successes.

  Generalise it: **before batching any shipped interactive aid, ask what the human at the
  cursor was contributing.** These scripts are written for an analyst who supplies context
  the code does not check, and the missing check is usually invisible in the output.
- **"There is no provable devirtualization here" is a claim about your MECHANISM until you
  have tried the dataflow APIs.** A round in this project concluded devirtualization was
  impossible and gave the reason as "real devirtualization needs reaching-definitions
  dataflow to track `this` across basic blocks". Ghidra ships that:
  - `DecompilerUtils.getBackwardSlice` / `getBackwardSliceToPCodeOps` /
    `getForwardSlice(ToPCodeOps)` / `getDataTypeTraceForward|Backward`. `HighFunction` p-code
    is **SSA with `MULTIEQUAL` phis**, so a slice crosses basic blocks by construction;
    `Varnode.getDef()` / `getDescendants()` / `getLoneDescend()` are the raw def-use edges.
  - `SymbolicPropogator` (+ `ConstantPropagationContextEvaluator`) runs over raw
    instructions with no decompiler and no signature dependency, and its `Value` exposes
    **`isRegisterRelativeValue()` / `getRelativeRegister()`** — it models `this + K`
    natively, making it structurally independent of any decompiler-based witness.
    **IT IS NOT READ-ONLY, AND IT LAUNDERS INTO THE `ANALYSIS` TIER.** Verified on a 12.1.2
    install: `SymbolicPropogator.java:2725-2730` creates every recovered reference with
    `instruction.addMnemonicReference(target, refType, SourceType.ANALYSIS)` /
    `addOperandReference(...)`, and the only veto is a `ContextEvaluator` — `evaluateReference`
    at :2735-2740 opens with `if (evaluator == null) { return target; }`, a non-null return, so
    **running it with no evaluator writes references at the analyzer tier**. That is the same
    laundering shape this document refuses in `AddVfunctionCallRefScript`, in a tool it otherwise
    recommends. To use it as a pure witness, pass a `ContextEvaluator` whose `evaluateConstant`
    and `evaluateReference` return `null`; `ContextEvaluator` is a plain interface, so
    `@JImplements` works from PyGhidra. Other gotchas: it needs `recordStartEndState=true`
    (docstring-confirmed) — *the claim that `saveContext=true` is ALSO required for
    `getRegisterValue` is **UNVERIFIED**, and reading :186-219 with :344-359 suggests it may not
    be; measure it before repeating it* — and its recording default changed in **11.4.1**
    (`docs/ChangeHistory.md:678`, GP-5804), **not** 12.0 as an earlier revision of this document
    said.
  - Interprocedural templates ship as scripts: `ShowConstantUse.java` ("walk backward
    through function calls to find any constants that find their way directly into the
    variable") and `WindowsResourceReference.java`.
  - Heavier, also shipped: the `TaintAnalysis` module, the `SymbolicSummaryZ3` extension,
    `ExportPCodeForCTADL.java`, and a **LiSA** abstract-interpretation extension with a
    runnable launch script.

  A negative result is only as strong as the strongest mechanism you actually ran. Name the
  mechanism in the finding, or the next round inherits a conclusion it cannot audit.
- **A VPTR-STORE CHAIN NAMES ANCESTORS, NOT PARENTS — the optimizer deletes the links you
  need most.** The parentage rule at the end of this section ("get parentage from constructors,
  not from table similarity")
  is right about *direction* and silently optimistic about *immediacy*. MSVC writes
  `*this = &vftable` once per class in each constructor and each destructor — and then
  **deletes any such store nothing can observe before the next one overwrites it.** An
  intermediate class contributes a link if and only if something between its store and the
  next store can see the vptr. Measured on one 1999 MSVC/x86 binary, in both directions
  within one round:
  - **Survives:** a factory storing base table `B`, then `CALL <ctor>` with `this` in ECX,
    then its own table. The call could read the vptr, so `B` stays.
  - **Elided:** a factory whose intermediate constructor was INLINED, so the sequence is
    grandparent-store, plain field initialisers, own-table store. The intermediate's write is
    dead and gone — and the derived class's records name the **grandparent** as its parent,
    self-consistently and forever. Proof the write existed: the same class also has a
    standalone out-of-line constructor, never called from that factory, performing the
    identical field initialisations *and* the store.

  The destructor side is identical: three classes' deleting-dtor thunks all called the same
  out-of-line destructor, which reset the vptr to a table **two levels up**, because the
  intermediate classes' destructors were trivial and their stores dead. An agent reading only
  destructors and an agent reading only constructors produced contradictory parents for the
  same six classes, each with a clean derivation.

  So: **a vptr chain always yields a true ANCESTOR and never proves an IMMEDIATE base, and a
  missing link is not evidence of a missing class.** Consequences worth acting on:
  - Label the column honestly — *nearest observed ancestor* — or a later round will "correct"
    correct data. Where slot-prefix similarity says a nearer table exists (equal or near-equal
    slot counts, a large shared-slot margin), that is the signal to look for an elided store,
    not a contradiction to resolve by picking a winner.
  - **Recover the elided link from the class's own out-of-line constructor**, which usually
    exists even when every factory inlines it. Matching *field-initialiser sets* between the
    inlined and out-of-line forms is what ties them together.
  - **Two agents disagreeing is a finding about the MECHANISM, not a tie to break.** Both
    derivations here were sound; the ranking question ("which is closer?") was the wrong
    question, and asking it would have discarded one correct answer.
- **A LEAFNESS RULE THAT READS VPTR STORES ALONE CANNOT SEE THE ORDINARY SUBCLASS.** "Does any
  body store this class's table and then a different one?" is the natural way to ask whether a
  class has a subclass, and it is only half the question. MSVC emits a derived constructor as
  `call base_ctor; mov [this], own_vftable`, so the base's vptr store lives in the **base's**
  body and never appears in the derived one — a store-only rule therefore sees only a subclass
  whose base constructor was **inlined**, and returns `LEAF` for every class whose children were
  compiled the normal way. Measured on one binary: it returned `LEAF` for the class with **four**
  subclasses while giving the right answer for the three classes that really are leaves, which
  is exactly why nothing looked wrong. **Classify a body by its vtable stores AND its calls to
  the class's constructor**, and take the demonstration from ground truth rather than a
  constructed poison: a class the binary itself declares subclasses for is a must-fire arm that
  costs nothing and cannot go inert.
- **"IS THERE A FUNCTION AT THIS ADDRESS" IS A CLAIM ABOUT THE DATABASE, AND IT DOES NOT BELONG
  IN A STRUCTURAL TEST.** This document already says a cross-reference count is a fact about the
  database rather than the binary. The same mistake hides one rung down, inside predicates that
  feel like observations: a "is this immediate a vtable?" test written as *every slot is a
  defined function entry point* refused **three genuine tables** on one binary, whose slot
  targets were real code in bytes Ghidra had never disassembled. Test what the binary
  guarantees — *the slots point into executable memory, at distinct addresses* — and **print
  each slot's kind** (`function` / `code` / `undisassembled` / `not-executable`), so the missing
  definitions stay visible as findings instead of being swallowed by the relaxation that admits
  them. Those slots are usually a real population worth a round of their own.
- **A DIFFERENT HIERARCHY CAN USE DIFFERENT SLOT NUMBERS, AND A SLOT-KEYED SWEEP REPORTS A CLEAN
  ZERO ON IT.** A slot index is a per-hierarchy convention, not a program-wide one. Measured: a
  binary's main object tree put `Save`/`Load` at slots **45/46**, a second, unrelated family put
  them at **0/1**, and every sweep keyed to the first numbering passed silently over the second
  — which was then written up across three rounds as "these classes are non-polymorphic, which
  is why every vtable-driven route is blind to them". The classes had vtables the whole time.
  **Before concluding a population has no vtable, ask which slot you were looking in.**
- **CLOSE A BLINDNESS GUARD ON EVERY ROUTE THE CLAIM RESTS ON, NOT JUST THE SEARCHABLE ONE.**
  Byte-searching for a vtable's address finds vptr stores hidden in undisassembled code; it can
  **never** find a hidden `E8 rel32` call, because the encoding is position-dependent. A guard
  covering only the searchable half reads as complete and is not. The other half is cheap and
  exact: enumerate the undisassembled ranges inside executable blocks (`Listing.getUndefinedRanges`
  over `Memory.getExecuteSet()` — it returns an `AddressSet`, so iterate `getAddressRanges()`)
  and decode every relative call in them. Measured on one binary: **5,317 ranges / 88,842 bytes**,
  and both halves paid — the store search found two real undisassembled destructors, and the call
  decode returned a *measured* zero instead of an assumed one.
- **A PREMISE RECORDED IN A NOTES FILE IS AN UNTESTED CLAIM, AND EVERY ROUND BUILT ON IT INHERITS
  IT WITHOUT RE-READING IT.** The self-harvest rules here are about evidence; this is the same
  failure on the *scoping* axis, and it is cheaper to fall into because nothing is ever written
  down twice. Measured: one round's parenthetical — "almost certainly non-polymorphic, which is
  precisely why every vtable-driven route here is blind to them" — scoped the next three rounds,
  one of which declined a rule that would have decided two open sizes *because* of it. It was
  refuted by a decompilation printed in one of those very rounds. The tell was not subtle and it
  was not missed for lack of evidence; it was missed because the premise had stopped being a
  question. **When three rounds in a row inherit the same negative premise, re-derive it from the
  program before the fourth** — and prefer premises stated as a probe that can be re-run over
  premises stated as a sentence.

- **Three byte-identical functions that were NOT folded are a cheap measurement that ICF is
  off.** "Identical-code folding hides overrides" is a real hazard and it is also frequently
  asserted without being checked. If a build emits per-class deleting-destructor thunks with
  identical bodies at distinct addresses, `/OPT:ICF` was not in effect, and every "X does not
  override Y" claim stops needing the ICF caveat. One decompile of two sibling thunks settles
  it.
- **"Zero cross-references" is a claim about the DATABASE, not the binary.** A reference from
  bytes the disassembler never made into a function is invisible to the reference model, so
  `getReferencesTo` returns an honest, empty, wrong answer — and the natural reading of that
  zero ("compiled but never instantiated", "dead code") is a strong conclusion built on a
  tool limitation. Measured: a vtable reported as having zero references of any kind had
  exactly one, inside an out-of-line constructor Ghidra had not recognised, findable only by
  byte-searching the image for the address. The blind population is precisely the undefined
  code that function-discovery rounds exist to convert — i.e. it shrinks as the project
  progresses, which is why the claim looks safer than it is. Byte-search for the address
  before recording any reference-count zero; it costs seconds.
- **Slot-index correspondence gives free names**, under single inheritance: if a base
  table's slot *i* is a named exported virtual and a derived table's slot *i* is `FUN_xxxx`,
  that function *is* the override. ABI mechanics, not inference — but check the
  preconditions in the reference, and expect virtual destructors to sit in slots as
  compiler-generated deleting-destructor thunks rather than as `~Class`.
- **Get parentage from constructors, not from table similarity.** Similarity is symmetric
  and inheritance is not, so ranking candidate bases by shared slots needs *something* to
  supply direction — and using depth for it is a trap: a derived class that adds no new
  virtuals has exactly its base's slot count, so a "parent must be strictly shallower" rule
  makes the real parent ineligible and silently returns the **grandparent**, self-consistently.
  A constructor stores each base's vftable into offset 0 in turn, which *is* directional.
  Mechanics and the measured failure: `references/cpp-abi.md`, "Recovering *which* class
  derives from which".

## Recover the INTERFACE before the classes, and read the roots, not the leaves

When a family of classes shares a vtable layout, the unit worth reading is **the interface, not the
class**. Measured on one 1999 MSVC/x86 binary, over 45 related GUI classes:

| | |
|---|---|
| distinct method bodies across the 45 tables | 188 |
| supplied by the two root tables | **33** |
| subclass overrides | 155 |
| slots a median class overrides | **4** |

The two roots turned out to **share 15 of their 20 base slots outright** — identical target
addresses — so one derived from the other and 33 bodies explained all 188. A round priced at "220
unnamed functions" was really priced at 33.

The order that follows from this:

1. **Diff the tables against each other first.** Equal target address at equal slot = inherited;
   different = override. That partitions the whole family before a single body is opened, and it
   costs one join over the vtable dump.
2. **Read the root's slots.** Each one you understand is understood for every class in the family —
   and if your citation system has a `slot k of table T` witness, each is *citable* for all of them
   at once.
3. **Read the overrides last.** They are the class-defining behaviour, and they only make sense once
   you know what the slot they replace is *for*.

### Identity is an OUTPUT of this, not an input

The tempting move is the opposite one: name the classes first, so the methods have somewhere to
live. It inverts the dependency. **A vtable is unattributed precisely because no name-supplying
route reaches it** — no RTTI, no mangled export naming the type, no registration string — so the
only evidence about it is what its methods DO. Naming the class first means inferring it from
behaviour you have not read yet.

Check before you start whether a name route really is exhausted: on that family, **no exported
mangled signature named a single one of the 51 unattributed tables**, and confirming that took one
join and settled the question.

### Validate an interface reading against a SUBCLASS before applying any of it

A claim about slot *k* is a claim about every class in the family, so it is worth far more than one
body's worth of care — and it is cheap to test, because the overrides are independent evidence.

Worked: slot 13 was read as "a child element told me it was chosen" from an **empty** base
implementation plus its two call sites. Two override bodies confirmed it outright — each compared
its argument against the child pointers that class had stored at construction and dispatched
accordingly. In the same pass, one of those overrides fetched a string by calling **slot 11** on a
child, which independently confirmed a `GetText` reading taken minutes earlier from a four-byte
body.

Three shapes worth recognising while reading such a family:

- **A slot that recurses into a child list through a fixed vtable displacement tells you its own
  index.** `(**(code **)(*child + 0x40))()` inside slot 16 is slot 16 calling itself on children —
  a free self-consistency check on your slot numbering.
- **An empty body (`ret`) in the base is a hook, not a stub.** Name it from its callers and its
  overrides, or leave it: a hook with no observed caller has no recoverable meaning.
- **A flag word tested by the resource/branch logic is the key to the verbs.** Once you know which
  bit selects the "disabled" artwork, the method that sets that bit is `Disable` — witnessed rather
  than guessed.

### The same trap, one round later, with the rule already written down

**This section was written on 2026-08-26 from the incident above. On 2026-08-27 the next
project round walked into the same trap anyway, and the failure is worth more than the rule.**

A round built a fresh evidence-pack generator that mapped vtable slot -> method name for a
45-class GUI family, and merged TWO roots into one map. The family is four branches: a 20-slot
base, and siblings of 28, 24 and 21 slots each extending it independently. The merged map
propagated the 28-slot branch's `Open`/`Close`/`SelectByCommandId` onto panels and buttons that
have no such methods. **7 of 61 mechanically-derived names would have been confidently wrong.**

Nothing above is new — the rule states the sibling case as *guaranteed*, not likely. What is new
is **why the rule did not fire**:

- **The round never asked the question, because the slot map came from an ARTIFACT JOIN.** The
  earlier incident keyed on the hierarchy root and got caught pricing candidate names. Here the
  map was assembled by a producer as a lookup table, and a lookup table has no step at which
  anyone asks *"is this index within the common ancestor?"* **Encode the precondition in the
  data structure, not in the analyst's attention**: key the map by `(branch_root, slot)`, never by
  `slot` alone. The bug is a `dict` that should have been two.
- **The check is one artifact column.** Comparing the ancestors' vtable LENGTHS settles it, and
  most projects already store the length. It costs one read and it was not taken.
- **Where a class's own branch has no decided name for a slot, SKIP — do not borrow.** Borrowing
  across the boundary is free, silent, and produces exactly the confident-wrong-name outcome the
  trust model exists to prevent. List the skipped addresses so the gap is a backlog item.

**What caught it was `RET imm16` — the second witness this section already recommended.** A
delegated reader counted pushed arguments in the disassembly: the 24-slot branch's slot 21 takes a
`char *` and copies it into a field, while a screen calls its slot 21 with nothing pushed, and one
virtual index cannot carry both signatures. **A join over a slot table structurally cannot see a
signature** — it sees occupancy only — so no amount of artifact cross-referencing would have found
this. That is the general rule (*a producer only finds what its witness kinds can see*) landing on
the producer itself.

**The transferable lesson is not about vtables.** A rule written in a reference file is not a rule
applied; it fires only where something in the workflow ASKS it. When a lesson's remedy is "check
X before Y", the durable fix is a structure or a check that cannot proceed without X — here, a
selftest pinning the branch boundary in both directions, so a merged map fails loudly instead of
producing plausible names.

## An EMPTY virtual in a base class is a design statement — read it as one

An inherited virtual whose body is `ret` looks like an omission, a stub, or dead weight, and it is
usually skipped. It is often the most informative method on the class, because **it marks a boundary
the design deliberately put somewhere else.**

**Measured.** A game's `CGobject::Load(FILE*)` — ground truth, an exported mangled symbol — is
completely empty, while its sibling `CGobject::Save(FILE*, int)` writes the object's header: type
id, handle, parent. 77 classes inherit both unchanged, which read as a coverage gap ("they save and
never load").

The asymmetry is correct and necessary: **the object cannot read its own type id, because the type
id is what decides which object to construct.** The header must be consumed by a container that
reads the id, dispatches to a factory, constructs, and only then calls the virtual. The empty
override is where the object's responsibility ends and the container's begins.

Generalising: when a base virtual is empty while its counterpart is not, ask *what would have to be
true elsewhere for this to be correct?* The usual answers are a container, a dispatcher, or a
two-phase construction — all of them structure you have not found yet, and all of them worth more
than the field lists the non-empty side yields.

### Read the EXPORT-NAMED subsystem before building an instrument for it

A corollary of the free-names sweep that is easy to lose once a project is under way. Round zero
counts the mangled exports and moves on; rounds twenty through thirty build probes.

**Measured.** An arc spent three rounds inferring the shape of a save format — a probe over the
per-object serializers, a residue census, a cross-check adjudication — and the layer that explained
all of it consisted of six functions the binary **had already named itself**:
`?SaveAll@CGobject@@SAXPAU_iobuf@@H@Z`, `?LoadAll@…`, `?AddClassId@…`, `?Create@…`,
`?GetClassNameA@…`, `?GetExtraData@…`. Reading them applied no names, inferred no identities, and
answered every open question the three previous rounds had produced.

**Before writing a probe for a subsystem, list the exported symbols whose names contain the
subsystem's vocabulary.** `Save`, `Load`, `Create`, `Add`, `Get`, `All` — the static-member and
manager functions are exactly the ones a C++ codebase tends to export, and they are exactly the
container/dispatch layer that per-object analysis cannot see. It costs one grep against the export
table you already harvested in round zero.


## A debug string names where code WAS, not where it IS

A common and productive naming route in a stripped C++ binary: the developers' own self-announce
idiom, where a method passes a literal like `"CFoo::Bar"` to a logging or debug-string call. Bind
the literal to the class whose vtable **declares** the slot that body occupies, and you have named
the class.

**Measured on one 1999 MSVC/x86 binary, that rule decided two class identities correctly and would
have decided a third one wrongly.** The literal `"COutpost::WaitingToTeleportBrain"` sits in the
`.rdata` block of vtable `V_base`, referenced from a body `V_base` declares and no ancestor does —
textbook. But the game's own class-id registry binds `COutpost` to a **different** vtable entirely.
The method had been **hoisted out of `COutpost` into a shared base during development, and its debug
string went with it.**

**The precondition the rule needs, and it is cheap:**

> The class named by the string must not already be bound to a *different* vtable by an independent
> route — a factory/class-id registry, an RTTI record, an exported symbol, a constructor's vptr
> store.

Two checks make the audit mechanical, and both are joins you already have:

1. **Shallowest carrier.** Of every vtable carrying that body at that slot, take the one that is an
   ancestor of all the others. If it is not the class the string names, the string is hoisted.
2. **Competing binding.** Look the string's class name up in every independent name→vtable route. A
   hit on a different vtable refutes outright.

Applied to the two live decisions, both passed on both checks; the counterexample fails both. **A
rule that has never met its counterexample has an unwritten precondition — and you learn it by being
handed one, not by re-reading the rule.**

The same hazard shows up wherever a symbol outlives a refactor: `__FUNCTION__`/`__PRETTY_FUNCTION__`
strings, assert text carrying a stale class name, and format strings in logging macros. Treat a
class name inside a *string* as evidence about the string's ORIGIN, and only then, with the
precondition checked, as evidence about the code that now carries it.

## Corollary: a citation must be true at the scope the checker verifies

The same binary produced a genuinely correct identification that a naming applier **refused, rightly**.
A save/load pair was identified from a literal pushed by a resolver stub **in the same translation
unit** — the stub resolves the name into a cache that the initialiser dereferences to build the very
global the pair iterates. Real evidence, and it even explained an open puzzle about the format.

The applier rejected it: *"this body does not touch that address."* Disassembly confirmed the body
references no string and no global — it operates purely on `this`. The witness kind claimed
`string_literal`, which in that project's vocabulary means *this body references this string*, and
the row asserted something false.

**Keep the witness vocabulary's scope honest.** If every accepted witness kind is body-scoped, a
translation-unit argument cannot be encoded as one, however sound it is — record it as held. If you
add a TU-scope kind, its boundary must be mechanically checkable (the contiguous range between two
exported symbols is one such definition), or it degenerates into a licence to attribute any nearby
string to any body.

And note which way the earlier failure ran: that pair had been declined once with *"no strings, no
ground-truth callees"* — true of the two **bodies**, false of the **translation unit**. **Scope the
naming SEARCH to the TU; scope the CITATION to what the checker can verify.** They are different
questions and conflating them costs you either a name or a false citation.


## A vptr store identifies the class in a CONSTRUCTOR and not in a DESTRUCTOR

"The body stores a vftable into `[this]`, so it belongs to that vftable's class" is the most
reliable hand-read name available on an MSVC binary without RTTI. It is sound for
constructors and **wrong for destructors**, and the failure is silent because the store is
right there in the disassembly.

**Constructor.** The base constructor runs first and stores the base vftable; the derived
constructor then overwrites it. Both stores are live — the object really does hold the base
vptr for the duration of the base ctor — so the LAST store is the most-derived class. The
idiom works.

**Destructor.** The order reverses: the derived destructor stores its own vftable, then the
inlined base destructor stores the base's. Nothing reads the first store between them, so
the compiler's dead-store elimination deletes it. What survives in the binary is the
**base's** store. Read naively, every trivial derived destructor in the program claims to
belong to its base.

Measured on a 1999 MSVC/x86 target, from a single evidence pack:

- Two bodies write the identical `CTbdStaticResource` vftable, but their array-destruction
  loops step **4** and **0x18** bytes. Two different element sizes cannot be the same class.
- **Ten byte-identical 32-byte bodies** all write `CMover`'s vftable, while `CMover`'s own
  slot 0 is a different address entirely. Naming them from the store would have produced
  ten identical, confidently wrong names.

**What to use instead, for a destructor:** the vtable the body is a SLOT TARGET of, not the
vtable it stores. A slot-0 target is that table's class; the stored vftable is its base.

**And the related trap that costs an apply:** slot 0 of an MSVC polymorphic class holds the
**deleting destructor** (`vector deleting destructor` / scalar), not `~X`. A body that is a
vtable slot target and reads like a destructor should be named `<Class>::vector_deleting_dtor`
or the scalar equivalent — never `~Class`, which belongs to a different body reached from it.
On the project above a gate caught exactly this, 0 → 8, immediately after an apply; the
distinction is worth a check of its own, because a reader following the vptr-store rule
correctly will still produce the wrong KIND of name.

**Two array strides that differ are a class-identity witness in their own right.** A
destruction loop's stride is `sizeof(element)`, so it can refute a shared-vftable reading
without any other evidence — and where it agrees with a recorded class size it corroborates
one. The same signal has a second reading worth knowing: a body whose loop strides
`sizeof(T)` while calling a per-element destructor is an **array-destruction helper**, not
the destructor. Mistaking one for the other puts a real, already-correct ground-truth name
onto the wrong address, which a collision check against your own applied-name ledger cannot
see — the existing name came from the binary and never entered that ledger. Join against the
PROGRAM.

## An override that calls its ancestor's same-slot body names its own member

When a slot-keyed naming route is closed — the slot index collides across sibling branches by
construction, and every export-named ancestor slot has already propagated — the residue is a set
of unnamed overrides under ancestor slots that carry only *your own* applied names, and those
names may be labels for what the base's body does rather than the member's name. That residue
looks like "one body read each". It has a mechanical core, and the call graph already holds it.

**The witness.** `Derived::f` compiled from `void Derived::f(x) { Base::f(x); ... }` calls the
exact body the base's table points at in the same slot. An unnamed override whose callee set
contains its nearest differently-bodied ancestor's slot target is therefore an override of *that*
member — whatever the slot index says, and whatever the sibling tables call theirs. A body that is
nothing but that call is a forwarder; one that opens with it is call-and-extend. Both name the
member; neither needs a decompiler read.

**Calibrate it before sweeping it.** Over the pairs where both ends were already named on different
bodies, measured on one 1999 MSVC/x86 binary: the witness fired on 24% of agreeing pairs and 8% of
disagreeing ones — a discriminator, not a proof — and *every* disagreeing pair that fired had the
ancestor's name as the member and the override's as a behaviour label (`CCryoFarm::CreateBuildCrew`
calling `CFactory::CreateChildAtSelf`; `BriefingScreen_Activate` calling `Activate`). So where the
witness fires, the name to propagate is the one nearer the slot's declaring class, and the specific
name belongs in a comment. Listing those disagreeing callers is the cheapest audit of your own
naming vocabulary you will get.

**What it will not do.** It cannot name an override that does its own work without calling the
base (157 of 320 here), and it cannot name anything under an ancestor slot that is itself unnamed —
though it links those into equivalence classes worth recording, since one future name resolves the
whole class. Sweep the call graph first; spend the body reads on what it leaves.

## An empty base constructor is elided, and it takes the ancestry evidence with it

Most routes for recovering "class D derives from class B" in an MSVC binary read the same thing:
**a store of B's vftable pointer into `[this]`** — from D's constructor before it installs its own,
from D's destructor as it unwinds, from a factory that inlines both. A project accumulates five or
six such routes and they feel independent. They are not: they share one witness.

**The compiler deletes that witness whenever B's constructor contributes nothing.** Two stores to
`[this]` with no observable read between them is a dead store, and it goes:

```
; what the source says: D::D() : B() {}      with B::B() empty apart from its vptr
0x00484546: PUSH 0x48
0x00484548: CALL operator_new
0x00484554: MOV dword ptr [EAX],0x4e1d64     ; D's vptr. B's store was here and is gone.
```

So **a base whose constructor is empty is invisible to every vptr-store route at once**, and the
class it bases reads as deriving from its *grandparent* — plausibly, consistently, and with every
gate green. The same elision hits destructors: both classes' scalar deleting destructors restore
the grandparent's table directly, with no intermediate step, for the same reason.

**The tell is a sibling where the elision did not happen.** The store survives whenever anything
sits between it and the derived store that the compiler cannot prove non-aliasing — most commonly
a member-array construction loop:

```
0x004843ba: MOV dword ptr [EAX],0x4e1c80     ; base vptr -- SURVIVES
0x004843c0: LEA ECX,[EAX + 0x58]             ; 12 x 104 element loop
   ...
0x0048440f: MOV dword ptr [EAX],0x4e1bc4     ; derived vptr
```

Measured on one 1999 MSVC/x86 binary: of two classes deriving from the same empty base, exactly one
kept the store — and that one store was the only reason the base was a known node at all. **If a
hierarchy has an intermediate class with exactly one recorded child, suspect it has more.**

**Recovering the missing edge without the store.** Two artifact-only measures, and you need both:

1. **Slot agreement** — the fraction of the base table's slots the candidate derived table
   reproduces at the same index. Calibrate it on the base/derived pairs you already have (measured
   here over 240 pairs: median 0.97, p10 0.85). A real edge scored 0.957 where the grandparent it
   displaced scored 0.851. **Not a longest-common prefix**: slot 0 is usually the destructor and
   every derived class overrides it, so a prefix test scores 0 on genuine inheritance.
2. **A slot target private to the pair** — a body in both tables and in *no other*. Agreement alone
   is high between cousins in a deep hierarchy; a shared implementation nobody else has is what
   separates a base from a cousin.

**Witness 2 is only valid if the linker did not fold identical functions**, so measure that before
you rely on it. Normalise each function's disassembly by rebasing only its *own* self-relative
branch targets, then group: if identical-but-distinct bodies exist in quantity, `/OPT:ICF` was not
applied and a shared body means inheritance. Measured here: **82 distinct bodies in two or more
byte-identical copies, 282 redundant copies**, including the two destructors of the very family
under investigation. Had that come back zero, witness 2 would have been worthless.

**Fold such an edge as ANCESTRY, never as an immediate base**, and let the existing ranker decide
immediacy — the elision can hide a link anywhere in a chain, so "B is an ancestor of D" is all the
evidence supports.

### Orienting an inheritance edge when the slot measures cannot

Slot-agreement and shared-body witnesses are **symmetric in the pair**: they say two vtables are
related, never which is the base. Two things break the tie, and both are cheap.

- **MEMBER-INITIALISATION ORDER AROUND THE VPTR STORE.** Under MSVC a member initialised *after*
  a vptr store belongs to the class whose vptr was just installed; one initialised *before* it
  belongs to a base. Measured on a pair of 47-slot tables identical in 46 slots: the same six
  dword initialisations fell **after** the vptr store in one constructor and **before** it in the
  other, which settles the direction outright — and, as a bonus, re-attributes every one of those
  members, and the serialised record built from them, to the base. Compiler store reordering makes
  this strong rather than ironclad; corroborate it with allocation sizes where a factory exists.
- **ALLOCATION SIZE, where both classes have a factory.** A derived class cannot allocate less
  than its base. Equal sizes for both members of a pair are weak evidence *against* a base/derived
  relation and *for* two siblings under a shared base.

**A class that is never instantiated has NO VFTABLE AT ALL**, because MSVC emits the vftable with
the constructor. So an abstract intermediate base is invisible to any hierarchy whose nodes are
table addresses — by construction, not through any producer's defect — and its member functions
surface only in its children's tables. When a symmetric pair resists orientation, that is the
hypothesis to state, and a table-keyed artifact structurally cannot falsify it.

**And a vtable whose only install site sits in bytes the disassembler never reached is invisible
to every ancestry route at once**, since all of them read a vptr store. Censusing *that* — every
4-byte occurrence of every table address in the image, decoded, joined against function extents —
is a complete question with a small answer, and it names exactly which classes the hierarchy
cannot see and why.


## CONSTRUCTORS AND DESTRUCTORS STORE VPTRS IN OPPOSITE ORDER, AND EVERY PRODUCER THAT SCREENS ON "THE LAST STORE" NEEDS THAT FACT

In the MSVC single-inheritance layout a constructor installs the base table first and the object's
own table last; a destructor installs its own table on entry and **restores the base's on exit**,
before the conditional `operator delete`. So "the body whose last vptr store is class C's table"
identifies a constructor of C *and* a destructor of any class derived from C, and the two are
indistinguishable by that test alone.

Measured consequence on one project: a size harvester used exactly that screen, with no
constructor-versus-destructor test, and accepted a derived class's destructor as the base's
constructor. It then credited the base with the derived's construction extent — a **lower bound of
1268 bytes on a class whose allocation is 28**, wrong by 1240, committed, and green under every
gate for as long as the row existed. All three bodies that screen accepted for that class were
destructors.

The screen itself is cheap and checkable: a body is a destructor when the last table it stores is a
strict **ancestor** of the first. It calibrates against ground truth rather than a poison — on that
binary, the export table's own `C::C` and `C::~C` names classified **12 of 12** correctly in both
directions, and inverting the hierarchy made 12 of 12 wrong.

**The transferable rule is about producers, not about MSVC.** One file in that project documented
the store-order inversion as load-bearing for its own witness. A second tier, written later, made
the same "last store wins" assumption without it, and a third module implemented the screen
properly and was connected to neither. **When a rule is documented as load-bearing in one
producer, the question is never whether it is written down — it is which other producers make the
same assumption without it.** Grep for the assumption, not for the sentence.
