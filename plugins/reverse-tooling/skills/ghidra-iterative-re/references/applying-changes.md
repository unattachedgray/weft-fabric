# Applying changes — what to apply, and how to survive it

*Reference for the `ghidra-iterative-re` skill. Only `SKILL.md` is loaded when the
skill is invoked; this file is read on demand when its trigger fires. New lessons of
this kind belong here, not in `SKILL.md`.*

**Read this when:** you are about to mutate the program, emit a C header from recovered
types, or decide which apply is worth the round.

**In this file:**

- What actually improves decompilation
- Emit a C header, and add the assertions yourself
- Mutation safety — the rest of the bracket

## What actually improves decompilation

- **Function signatures.** Parameter/return types propagate to call sites — the strongest
  real cascade. Mangled names encode full signatures;
  `DemanglerCmd(addr, mangled).applyTo(program, monitor)` applies name *and* signature —
  and, with default options, **disassembles and can create a function** at the address
  (`DemanglerOptions.doDisassembly` defaults to `true`). It is a mutating operation of the
  same class as the ones you bracket, not a naming convenience.

  **But measure the VARIANCE before you commit one, because the Parameter ID analyzer got
  there first.** "Signatures propagate to call sites" is true and it is not a licence: a
  committed signature's payoff is that it replaces N *different* per-site guesses with one
  answer, so the round is worth exactly what N is — and where the Decompiler Parameter ID
  analyzer has already run, N is often 1. Measured on one binary, on the two highest-fan-in
  functions in it (a custom arena allocator and its free, 852 call sites): both already
  carried an analyzer-committed `__cdecl` one-parameter prototype at
  `SignatureSource=ANALYSIS`, structurally identical to the one the planned round proposed,
  and decompiling all 428 callers and inspecting every CALL p-code op found **361 of 361**
  allocator sites already rendering one argument and `int *`, and **475 of 475** free sites
  already rendering one argument and no result. Zero variance on either axis; the round
  evaporated on one read-only probe. Count the distinct (arity, return type) pairs across the
  call sites first — that number *is* the payoff.

  Two traps ride along with it, both measured in that round:
  - **The more CORRECT type can be the less USEFUL one, and the summary line cannot show
    it.** `void *` is right for an allocator and `int *` is a decompiler guess — but every
    one of those 361 sites *consumes* the return, and `int *` renders a dereference directly
    where `void *` forces a cast at each use. Committing the correct type would have cost
    legibility at 361 sites for nothing measurable, while the round's own headline ("852 call
    sites given a committed signature") would have read as success. Grade a type change by
    what it does at the call sites that exist, not by which type is more nearly true.
  - **An `AI` signature does NOT outrank an `ANALYSIS` one, so the cascade may take it
    back.** Verified from the enum on a 12.1.2 install: `ANALYSIS` and `AI` are both priority
    **2**, `isHigherPriorityThan` false in *both* directions. Laying an AI-tagged signature
    over an analyzer-committed one is a peer overwrite that `analyzeChanges` is entitled to
    reverse — so check `getSignatureSource()` on the target *before* planning the apply,
    not after the cascade eats it.
- **Defining functions at undefined code.** Feeds analyzers new material, extends
  pointer-table runs truncated by undefined targets, adds call-graph edges. Often the
  highest-leverage single mutation.
- **Type vftable struct components as `Pointer` → `FunctionDefinition`, not as bare
  pointers.** The idiomatic build — `ClassUtils.getVftDefaultEntry(dtm)` — returns a plain
  `PointerDataType`, which names the slots but types nothing, so every virtual call still
  decompiles as `(*(code *)(*(int *)this + 0x48))()`. Build a `FunctionDefinitionDataType`
  from each slot TARGET's function instead and the same call renders
  `(*p->vftable->GetPos)(p)` with typed arguments and a return type that propagates into
  the caller's locals. Measured on one binary: 1053 of 1068 slots across 15 classes, from
  363 distinct definitions (slots share targets through inheritance), every one
  `__thiscall` with a real prototype. Two things make it cheap and safe: take the
  signatures only from targets carrying a MANGLED symbol, so the evidence tier is the
  binary's own string; and `Structure.replace(ordinal, ptr, 4, name, comment)` is a
  1-for-1 swap, so assert the struct's length and component count are unchanged and the
  blast radius is confined to decompilation. The slots you cannot type are usually the
  compiler-generated destructor thunks, which have no export by construction — leave them
  bare rather than inventing a signature.

  **CORRECTION, measured 170 program versions later: the apply described above produced
  SILENTLY WRONG C, and the reason is `this`.** Each definition was built from its target's
  signature with `this` left out, and kept `__thiscall`. A `FunctionDefinitionDataType` has no
  class to supply an automatic `this`, so the decompiler put the FIRST DECLARED parameter in
  ECX — measured from call renders: the first rendered argument is the dispatch object itself
  in 1146 of 1153 calls, e.g. `(*this->vftable->GetRender)((int)this)` for a method whose
  mangled name takes one `int` and whose body is `RET 4`. The decompiler therefore believes
  the callee pops four bytes fewer than it does, and **every later `[ESP+N]` read in the
  caller is off by four**: a pushed parameter is replaced by an unrelated stack slot holding a
  constant, the branch that tested it is folded away, and the only symptom is a generic
  `Removing unreachable block` warning. A related failure: a slot declared `void` whose body
  returns on the x87 stack renders its callers' use as `extraout_ST0`. **Build each definition
  with an explicit `this` pointer as its first parameter, and before trusting any typed slot,
  compare its declared stack cleanup against the target body's `RET n`** — a check no
  per-function signature audit performs, because it compares a function against itself, never
  against the prototype its call sites are typed with. The improvement in readability above was
  real, which is exactly why nobody looked for damage.

  **And the repair has its own trap: census the call sites that reach a definition by OVERRUN.**
  When an object is typed as a base class whose vftable struct is SHORTER than the slot being
  called, the decompiler indexes the table as an array (`vftable[1].IsTargetHit`) and borrows
  whatever definition sits at that position — an unrelated method. Measured on the same
  project: ~195 such call sites in 97 functions rendered the wrong method before the repair and
  after it; making the definitions correct changed 131 of them and turned 2 from plausible to
  catastrophic (one function lost 15 of its blocks), because the borrowed prototype had been
  wrong by four bytes in a direction that happened to look right. The repair still paid for
  itself many times over, but the two were foreseeable: grep the decompiled output for
  `vftable\[\d+\]` BEFORE applying, and treat the dispatching object's type, not the definition,
  as the defect at those sites.

  **A CORRECT FLOAT RETURN ON A TYPED SLOT CAN MAKE THE C WORSE, AND THE CAUSE IS A DECOMPILER BUG
  PRESENT IN EVERY RELEASE THROUGH 12.1.4 AND FIXED ON `master` (GP-7167, 2026-08-25).** On 32-bit x86, a virtual
  call through a vtable struct whose `FunctionDefinition` returns `float` or `double` renders as a
  bare statement, and the caller's use of the result appears later as `extraout_ST0`. The UNTYPED
  call `(float10)(**(code **)...)()` had bound the result correctly, because with no declaration the
  decompiler infers outputs from what the caller reads. Measured on one project: four DLL-implemented
  slots returning on the x87 stack, established by two witnesses, and typed correctly, made **31
  callers that previously produced trustworthy C worse**; left untyped, none got worse.
  - **The cause, verified by instrumenting the 12.1.2 decompiler.** A `float`/`double` is smaller
    than the 10-byte ST0, so `ParamEntry::getAddrBySlot` asks for a float-extension JOIN address
    through `spaceid->getManager()` -- the manager that created the REGISTER space, which is the
    `Translate` object, not the `Architecture`. Only the Architecture has a join space
    (`Architecture::restoreFromSpec` inserts it after `copySpaces`), so the join record is built with
    a null space and the address comes back INVALID. Storage assignment then falls through to the
    next output entry: **EAX for a `float`, EDX:EAX for a `double`**, type-locked. Nothing reads those
    after the call, the output is removed as dead, and the caller's real ST0 read is left dangling
    as `extraout_ST0`. Direct calls to a `Function` get their storage from the Java side and never
    take this path, which is why float returns on direct calls bind. PR #6715
    (<https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/pull/6715>, open and unreviewed since July
    2024) diagnoses the same bug and proposes forwarding the translator's join lookups; **`master`
    fixed it differently in GP-7167 (f17a0b5719)**, by passing the owning manager into
    `getAddrBySlot`. A standalone datatest -- a `__thiscall` vtable call with an argument, returning
    `float4`/`float8` -- fails 0/3 on 12.1.2 and passes 3/3 on master. A no-argument pointer call does
    NOT reproduce it (the decompiler's output recovery rescues it), so a test of this bug needs the
    vtable shape.
  - **You cannot fix it by dropping a master `decompile` into a release.** The native decompiler and
    the Java side change the pipe protocol in lockstep; master's GP-6985 added a message type that
    12.1.x Java rejects as an alignment error. The fix is the whole Ghidra (build master, pinned to a
    commit) or a local backport of GP-7167's `getAddrBySlot` change.
  - **Refuted candidates, so nobody re-tests them:** the return WIDTH as the cause (`float` and
    `double` both fail, by the mechanism above), and a missing ST0 output in the calling-convention
    model (`x86win.cspec` gives `__thiscall` the same `ST0, EAX` output list as the other
    conventions). A `float10` return fails too, but by a DIFFERENT path: it is turned into a hidden
    return pointer, consistent with its padded size exceeding ST0's `maxsize="10"` in the fallback
    assignment -- not investigated further, and not a workaround.
  - **The rule: before KEEPING a type, measure what the decompiler does with it at the call sites,
    not only whether it is right.** Dump the affected callers under both arms (typed and untyped,
    restoring the program afterwards) and score both with the same rule the quality gate uses; hold
    the type if it regresses, record the fact separately, and look for the decompiler bug. The
    correct type should still win in the end: hold it only until the bug is fixed upstream or locally.
  - **And audit the checks that were calibrated while the bug was live.** Measured on one project after
    moving to a build with the fix: a prototype-audit tool's calibration arm had pinned "this float slot
    loses its return at this caller" as ground truth, and failed on the fixed decompiler -- correctly.
    The same tool's defect list went from 27 rows to 0, because every row was the decompiler's failure
    on a float-DECLARED slot, filed as a defect in the slot typing. When every row of a defect list
    shares one shape, test the TOOL for that shape before repairing the rows; and grade a calibration
    whose positive case is a tool bug on a pinned fixture, not on the live output.
- **Struct layouts.** Field accesses become named. Can *change* signatures as a side
  effect: a large struct returned by value switches to the hidden return-storage-pointer
  convention, so `T Func(this)` becomes `T * Func(this, T *__return_storage_ptr__)`.
- **Data mutability.** *"The decompiler will display the contents of a memory location if
  the contents are marked as constant. Otherwise it will display a pointer to the
  location."* Settings: normal / constant / volatile / writable — per-data, or
  per-memory-block via the Memory Map. Marking genuinely read-only sections constant is
  factually correct, cheap, and high-leverage. Marking hardware registers **volatile**
  stops the decompiler folding away repeated reads.
- **"Exceeded maximum restarts with more pending" is a hard-coded cap, and better typing
  hits it.** Read from the decompiler source (master `d6192cb`, 12.3-DEV): `coreaction.cc`
  builds the main loop as `ActionRestartGroup(..., "universal", 1)`, allowing ONE restart, and
  `FuncCallSpecs::forceSet` (`fspec.cc`) requests a restart whenever a function-pointer type
  reaches an indirect call after data flow has committed. A typed virtual call whose receiver is
  the RETURN of another typed call (`obj->GetDerived()` then `derived->Method()`) is discovered
  only after the first restart and needs a second, so typing vtables makes the warning MORE
  common. The C it leaves looks like a slot-definition bug (the second call is rendered without
  its `this`) and is not one. Measured on one binary: 15 of 15 such functions cleared either by
  persisting the decompiler's own discovered prototypes as call-site overrides
  (`HighFunctionDBUtil.writeOverride`) or by rebuilding `decompile` with the cap at 4, and the two
  produced byte-identical C. Prefer the rebuild if you can pin a build: an override stores a COPY
  of the prototype, so a later slot retype silently misses every overridden call site. The cap is
  consulted only when exceeded, so a rebuild changes EXACTLY the functions carrying the warning;
  predict that, then check it (0 of 400 random controls changed, 15 of 5,649 over the full
  program). **General rule: when a decompiler warning recurs, grep its text in
  `Ghidra/Features/Decompiler/src/decompile/cpp/` before designing around it.**
- **Measure a type change's render trade over the CALLGRAPH of what changed, not over a
  pattern.** Before check-in, dump and score every function the change can re-render, then keep
  it only if the quality measure does not drop. Measured on one binary: a set chosen by call
  SPELLING (the vtable-slot renders expected at the call sites) missed a direct caller of a
  retyped function, which lost D5 and was found only in the whole-program measurement. The
  post-apply join then found two more spellings of the same typed call (`(member.vftable)->slot_N`
  on an embedded object, `pVtable->slot_N` through a copied vtable pointer). Build the set from
  the callgraph of every changed signature plus the slot targets, and treat the pattern-based set
  as a lower bound.
- **A census that reads UNTYPED renders must be pinned to the program version it was approved
  against.** The census that licensed a vtable struct counted call sites whose result is read,
  in the untyped spelling `(**(code **)(vtable + K))(...)`. After its own apply those calls render
  typed (`vtable->slot_N(...)`), the read vanishes from its pattern, and re-run it would declare
  a read slot `void`, i.e. it reads its own apply back. Name the approval version in the tool and
  refuse to re-derive from a later program; a typed-spelling matcher is not a safe substitute when
  several classes' structs render the same field names.

### Emit a C header, and add the assertions yourself

**Emit a C header from recovered types, and add the assertions yourself.** It is the bridge
to a reimplementation, it is diffable outside Ghidra, and generating it forces every
recovered layout to be complete and self-consistent rather than approximately right.

Emit the *types* with the built-in: **`ghidra.program.model.data.DataTypeWriter(dtm,
writer)`** is the public, supported ANSI-C type emitter ("The ANSI-C code should compile on
most platforms"). Do **not** reach for `CppExporter.CPPResult` — it is a **private nested
record**, uncallable from a script and absent from the javadoc, and `CppExporter` itself
decompiles the entire program as a side effect (options `CREATE_C_FILE`,
`CREATE_HEADER_FILE`, `EMIT_TYPE_DEFINITONS` — Ghidra's typo, not ours). It delegates its
type emission to `DataTypeWriter` anyway.

Then wrap that output yourself with `_Static_assert(offsetof(T, field) == K)` per field and
a `sizeof` assertion per class, and **compile it**. No Ghidra exporter emits compile-time
offset assertions, and the compile is the only step that recomputes offsets from the C
object model rather than from your own arithmetic — which is precisely the step worth
having. Hand-rolling the *type* emitter is the failure "Check for a built-in before writing
your own" (`references/api.md`) warns about; hand-rolling the *assertions* is the whole point.

**And emit FIXED-WIDTH types, not `char *` or `long`.** The target's word size is not the
host's, and getting this wrong silently relays every field after the offender. It breaks the
header, the recompile and the reimplementation — in that order of discovery and the reverse
order of cost. See **Target ABI vs host ABI** in `references/oracles-and-abi.md`.

### Mutation safety — the rest of the bracket

- **A scalar invariant is a smoke alarm, not a change set.** Keep the function count as the
  cheap canary, then get the real measurement: check the program in before the round, and
  afterwards run `ProgramDiff(checkpointProgram, currentProgram).getDifferences(
  ProgramDiffFilter(CODE_UNIT_DIFFS | SYMBOL_DIFFS | FUNCTION_DIFFS | REFERENCE_DIFFS |
  COMMENT_DIFFS), monitor)` → an `AddressSetView`. That enumerates categories a function
  count is *structurally* blind to — references, comments, register context, source map,
  equates, bookmarks. **`ProgramMerge`** then restores a *specific* category from the
  checkpoint (`mergeFunctions`, `mergeLabels`, `mergeCodeUnits`, `mergeComments`,
  `mergeReferences`, `replaceFunctionSignatureSource`), which is the closest thing to the
  undo that `canUndo()` refuses to give you for a previous script run's transaction.
  Version control works in a local, non-shared project, and Program Differences can diff
  against a version picked from the Version History table.
- **A confirmation pass earns its cost only when something CHANGED between passes.** A post-apply
  stability check (every read-only sweep re-run, outputs byte-compared) is run once to SURFACE
  what moved and again to CONFIRM the fixes. The second run tests the FIXES — a repaired script,
  a moved pinned count, a newly registered producer — so if the first run's only findings are
  changed artifacts, and a join of every changed row against the addresses the round itself
  wrote finds none outside it, the join IS the confirmation. A second run would compare against
  files the first run wrote, and could only catch a sweep that is nondeterministic on identical
  input. Measured on one project, where a pass costs ~30 minutes: a 12-row signature round found
  exactly the two predicted artifacts, 12 rows each, 0 outside the round, having made every
  predictable knock-on edit (pinned counts, producer registrations) BEFORE the first pass — the
  second pass bought nothing. The rule that saves the pass is the same one that avoided a third:
  **predict and pre-apply the knock-ons of your own apply, then run one pass.** Run the second
  when the first raised, found an unexplained row, or needed any edit to a check.
- **Scope address sets as narrowly as the operation allows.** Broad set + large archive
  is the dangerous combination; the incident did not reproduce narrowly.
- **`Function.setName(sameName, SourceType.X)` IS A NO-OP FOR THE SOURCE — and a mutation
  that silently does nothing is indistinguishable from one that worked.** Measured: a round
  re-tagging 22 project-applied names from `ANALYSIS` to `AI` called `setName` with each
  function's existing name and the new tier. Ghidra short-circuits when the name is
  unchanged, so no tier moved. All 22 calls returned cleanly, the census printed, the ledger
  was written, and the run would have reported success. `Function` has **no source setter at
  all**; **`Symbol.setSource(...)` is the API** — `dir()` on the live objects shows
  `getSignatureSource`/`setSignatureSource` on `Function` and `getSource`/`setSource` on
  `Symbol`. Two things generalise past the specific call:
  - **Count the population you claim to have changed.** Per-item calls that do not throw are
    not evidence; only a before/after count of the property itself is. Here
    `ai_symbols == before + N` was the sole check capable of noticing, and the same shape
    catches any API that silently declines.
  - **Ask the object rather than recall the API.** One five-line probe printing the
    SourceType-related members of `Function` and `Symbol` settled in seconds what reasoning
    from memory had already got wrong once.
- **A RAISED RUN LEAVES YOUR LEDGER AHEAD OF THE PROGRAM.** The ledger append precedes the
  verification, so a failed apply claims names it did not apply — and the ledger is what your
  provenance gates join against, so the damage lands in the guard rail rather than in an
  artifact. Revert the raised run's rows BY NAME before re-running.
- **BEFORE WRITING INTO A SLOT, ENUMERATE ITS READERS — AND ANSWER WITH A NUMBER, NOT A
  COMPATIBILITY ARGUMENT.** Comments, tags and bookmarks feel inert, and they are not: measured,
  a round adding provenance PLATE comments at every project-named address was writing into the
  exact slot `Ghidra`'s Function ID analyzer uses, which a standing gate read and regex-parsed a
  `Libraries:` block out of. The tempting move is to reason that a prepended block separated by
  a blank line cannot disturb a parser looking further down — and that reasoning was *correct*,
  which is precisely why it is not evidence. What shipped instead: a census counting the overlap
  (**1** address of 3618), a writer that prepends and preserves rather than replaces, and a
  before/after equality check on all **56** parses. Any slot with a reader needs the equality
  check; grep for who reads it before deciding it is inert.
- **RUN EVERY GATE AT THE NEW VERSION — "this round could not have touched it" is sound
  reasoning and still an assumption.** Measured: a state line was drafted claiming five gates
  green after a comment-only round when two had been re-run and two were inferred safe on the
  grounds that comments cannot move types or vtables. True, and it costs two minutes to find
  out. The most-read sentence in a project's records should carry measurements, not deductions.
- **A PRECONDITION MEASURED BEFORE A BATCH OF OPERATIONS CAN BE INVALIDATED BY THOSE
  OPERATIONS — re-check it immediately before the operation it guards.** Measured: an
  applier verified at census time that no type of a given name existed; a *merge step in the
  same run* then created one, because moving a function into a class namespace makes Ghidra
  materialise a placeholder struct of that name; the next step died on a duplicate-name
  exception with the round half-applied. A census is for deciding SCOPE. It is not a
  substitute for the check at the point of use.
- **WRITE A MULTI-STEP APPLY TO CONVERGE ON THE END STATE, NOT TO ASSUME THE START ONE.**
  `canUndo()` is `False` for a previous script run's transaction and your snapshot-restore
  path is probably untested, so a raise part-way through leaves a state you must be able to
  RE-ENTER. Make every step report "already" and do nothing when its end state holds; then a
  re-run on a finished program is a no-op that still verifies every intended fact, and
  forward recovery becomes provable rather than hopeful. Two things make it work:
  - **Derive the population from a REPO fact, not a PROGRAM fact.** Membership taken from an
    append-only ledger's last row per address survived the partial apply intact; membership
    read from "who currently occupies this namespace" would have made the round's scope
    depend on how far the failed run got.
  - **Give the applier a dry arm that runs the REAL code path** (`do=False` through the same
    convergence functions). That is the arm that catches this class of defect; a selftest
    built only from constructed inputs cannot.
- **`replaceDataType(placeholder, keeper, True)` MOVES the keeper into the DISCARDED type's
  category.** Measured: structs folded over demangler-created placeholders ended up under
  `/Demangler/`, not at the root where they had been, and every consumer looking up
  `"/" + name` silently reported them ABSENT. When you fold types, enumerate the consumers
  of the type's PATH, not just of its name.
- **AN INVARIANT BRACKET THAT CHECKS A *DELTA* GOES BLIND THE MOMENT A RUN RAISES.** Measured:
  an apply died part-way, and the next run's before/after delta compared two states that were
  *both* already wrong — the delta was clean and the program was damaged. Pin the bracket to an
  **absolute** expected value, not to "the same as when I started". The cost is that the pin must
  be re-set whenever you legitimately change the number, and that is the point: **a re-pin is a
  decision with a reason attached, a range is a decision to stop noticing.** Measured again two
  rounds later — a probe stopped on `datatypes=1396, expected 1395` after an apply that created
  exactly one array type. The temptation is `>=` or a tolerance; the correct move is to account
  for the delta from the apply's own record (one `created` row at that version boundary) and
  re-pin to 1396 with the reason in the comment. A range would have silently absorbed the next
  apply's collateral damage.
- **AN APPLIER THAT REBUILDS FROM AN ARTIFACT WILL DISCARD EVERY REFINEMENT THAT LIVES ONLY IN
  THE PROGRAM — AND NOTHING WILL NOTICE.** Measured: a re-run would have replaced a 268-field
  embedded record, applied by a later round directly into the program, with the one opaque
  `uint8_t[300]` the artifact still carried. The struct still tiles, its length is unchanged, and
  a bracket counting functions, symbols and datatypes sees nothing — the discarded type is still
  in the DataTypeManager, merely unreferenced. **Diff each already-final class against its own
  plan before writing, and hold back any class the program types more specifically.** Two traps
  inside that guard, both paid for:
  - **Compare RESOLVED types, not names.** The first version compared `getName()` and called every
    `dword` component richer than the plan's `uint32_t` — the same type under two names — so every
    already-applied class came back held-back for a reason unrelated to any refinement. It was
    right for two classes and wrong for a third: a check passing for the wrong reason.
  - **Decide what "more specific" means, explicitly, because that predicate is load-bearing in
    BOTH directions.** Placeholder shapes (`undefined*`, `uint8_t[N]`) must not count as richer.
    That one line is what later let the same guard handle the *opposite* case — an artifact that
    had grown FINER than the program — without modification: the coarse cells being replaced were
    placeholder-shaped, so they offered no resistance, while the genuine refinement did. **The
    guard was right for a case nobody designed it for, which is worth writing down**: the next
    edit to that predicate silently decides whether re-applies still work.
- **APPLYING AN OPAQUE `uint8_t[N]` OVER A REGION DOES NOT MERELY FAIL TO HELP — IT DEGRADES THE
  EVIDENCE NEEDED TO SUBDIVIDE THAT VERY REGION.** Measured: filling a class tail with a byte
  array made the decompiler re-render two dword stores as twelve one-byte stores, and one-byte
  cells across the harvest went 15 → 109. The round that applied it understated its own cost,
  because "the placeholder is neutral until we learn more" is the natural assumption and it is
  false. Two consequences: **take widths from the INSTRUCTION, never from the decompiler's
  varnode**, and expect any later attempt to subdivide that cell to be arguing against evidence
  your own apply corrupted. It is reversible — subdividing the cell later restored the same
  accesses to single dwords, with the instruction width identical throughout, which is the proof
  of which rendering was the false one.
- **A "NOTHING CHANGED" DETECTOR MUST COMPARE WHAT THE RUN WOULD WRITE AGAINST WHAT THE PROGRAM
  HOLDS — NOT A PROXY LIKE SIZE.** An idempotent applier needs to distinguish a genuine re-run
  (where before == after by construction, so a payoff delta is *unavailable* rather than *zero*)
  from a real change. Measured: the test was "is every target already at its final length", which
  cannot see a class at the same size whose contents the artifact has since subdivided. It would
  have reported a real, measured payoff as *"UNAVAILABLE ... not a gain this run produced"* —
  the same lie of form the unavailable branch exists to prevent, pointed the other way. Ask the
  question of the classes the run actually WRITES: one it deliberately holds back says nothing
  about whether anything changed. **When you change such a rule, print both the old verdict and
  the new one permanently** — that is the two-step diff baked in, and it costs one line.

### An applier's population rule does not follow the evidence; somebody has to move it

**Measured: 137 classes had no applied struct, and the cause was one gate keyed to the wrong
source.** The applier accepted a class only if a *naming* registry announced it. That was correct
when written — the naming registry was the layout source. The layout evidence later came from a
different witness entirely (constructor writes, 925 of 1046 rows), and **the gate did not follow**.
Over the 137: size decided **137/137**, base already laid out **137/137**, namespace 54/137,
declarer **0/137**.

Nothing warned, and nothing could: **a population rule that reaches nothing looks exactly like a
population that has nothing in it.** Both print zero and both leave the artifact empty.

- **The tell is a gate whose pass rate is 0 while every other gate on the same population passes
  ~100%.** Print every gate's pass count as a fraction of the population, always, including the
  ones you expect to pass — a single `ALL FOUR: 0 of 137` line beside four per-gate lines locates
  the binding constraint in one read.
- **Ask it of every applier you own, periodically and not only when a round stalls:** is this gate
  keyed to the evidence it applies, or to whatever source happened to exist the day it was written?
- The reason this survives so long is that the *stalled* population is invisible from inside the
  applier. It is only visible by joining the applier's gates against the population the evidence
  now covers — which is a read-only query nobody runs, because the applier reports success.

### Every mutating applier needs a state meaning "already exactly what I would write"

**Measured: an apply raised part-way — after writing all 19 types, before the cascade — and could
not be restarted.** Undo was unavailable (`canUndo=False`; the script provider's transaction was
not rolled back on the exception). The applier's state machine had three states: `absent`,
`placeholder`, `applied` — and `applied` meant *"somebody else's, refuse to touch it"*. So the 19
types the round had just written were indistinguishable from another round's, the route flipped to
`already_applied`, and the population guard would have raised on the disagreement. **A partial
failure is precisely when a resume is needed, and a three-state machine cannot offer one.**

The fix is a fourth state — *this is already exactly what I would write* — verified rather than
rewritten. Note it is not a weakening: it checks the shape in full (one component, right offset,
right field name, right type, right length) before granting it.

- **A sibling script in the same repo had the missing arm from the start.** Before designing a new
  applier's state machine, read the states of the most similar existing one; the expensive states
  are the ones somebody already learned to need.
- **Pin the census to the ROUTE population, not the number of writes.** A human approved "19". On
  the resumed run 0 needed writing; pinning to writes would have demanded `apply 0` and silently
  broken the tie to what was approved. The route population is 19 on both runs.
- **A raised run is not a no-op run.** Check what actually landed before deciding how to recover —
  here, querying one type settled it in one call, and the answer (not rolled back) determined the
  whole recovery path.

### Before choosing where an annotation lives, count how many of the population can carry it

**Measured: the obvious home for "this class adds no data members" is the type's own description,
and 96 of the 101 classes had no type at all.** That route would have recorded the finding for 5 of
101 and printed a clean summary — coverage theatre with no bug in it, because every write it
attempted would have succeeded.

Pick the anchor that **all** of the population has (here the dispatch table's address, which every
class has by construction), and state the coverage as a fraction before writing anything.

### Never destroy an existing annotation; append below it, and count the three cases separately

An address that already carries a comment usually carries *provenance* — which round named it, on
what evidence. Overwriting is silent and unrecoverable. Distinguish and count: **fresh** (nothing
there), **ours-refreshed** (drop your previous block by marker, re-add — so a re-run cannot
accumulate copies of itself), **appended below foreign text** (kept intact). Print all three; a
round that expected `fresh` and got `foreign_append` has learned something about the address space
before it writes.

### A naming apply creates TYPES you did not ask for

**Measured.** A round that applied **no types at all** — it named 203 functions into 98 newly
created class namespaces — moved the program's whole-datatype count by **+136** and changed a
`signature` column in an artifact three steps downstream.

The mechanism: creating a class namespace materialises a 1-byte placeholder *type* of that name,
and the cascade then types a `__thiscall` function's `this` against it. So "this is a naming round,
the type invariants cannot move" is false, and a round that reasons that way will be surprised by
its own gate.

Budget for it: **a naming round that creates namespaces should expect the datatype bracket to
fire**, and should plan the by-name account for the placeholders before running, not after. The
payoff is real and worth having — `this` typed at the class is what turns raw pointer arithmetic
into member access — but it is a type change arriving through a name-shaped door.

### When an apply's payoff disappoints, ask whether it is the wrong apply or the wrong ORDER

**Measured, on the same script run twice.** A struct apply over ~100 classes retyped **7 of 40**
functions and said so. Two rounds later the *identical* script, artifact and population rule
retyped **107 of 140**. Nothing about the apply changed; in between, a naming round had attributed
203 functions to those classes, and **a struct only retypes where a signature already points at
the class type**.

Both readings of the first result would have been wrong. "The apply is not worth it" would have
discarded a 15x payoff sitting one round away. "The measurement is pessimistic" would have been
dressing up a real number. What was right: apply anyway (the work was correct and the artifact was
needed), **state the small number plainly**, and record what the payoff was gated on — which is what
made the multiplier visible when it arrived.

The generalisation: an apply's benefit is often a product of two applies, and the one you are
holding may be the second factor. Before concluding a route is low-value, ask what its payoff is
*conditional on*, and whether that precondition is cheap and already on the backlog.

### Predict whether a round moves the type count, and be suspicious when the bracket disagrees

Two rounds, opposite shapes, measured:

| round | what it applied | datatype count |
|---|---|---|
| naming into new namespaces | **no types at all** | **+136** — `createClass` materialises a 1-byte placeholder per namespace, and the cascade types `__thiscall` `this` against it |
| structs over existing placeholders | **81 structs** | **0** — `replaceDataType` swaps in place under the same name |

So the intuitive rule is exactly backwards, and both surprises are cheap to avoid by predicting the
number before the run. A bracket that fires when you expected silence — or stays silent when you
expected a delta — means the apply did something other than what you believe, and that is worth
stopping for rather than re-pinning past.

### A derived type that is the same size as its base ties with it on every size-keyed join

**Measured.** Representing "this class adds no data members" as `struct Derived { Base base; }` is
correct and drift-free — and it necessarily creates a type of *exactly* its base's size. Do that
100 times and every witness that identifies a type BY SIZE gains candidates: a 128-byte block-copy
site went from two possible types to five, the three new ones being classes that had been 1-byte
placeholders the round before.

The new candidates are genuinely that size, so this is **dilution, not error** — but it is
permanent, it is invisible unless you diff the artifact, and it is a property of the design rather
than of any one round. Record it where the size-keyed witness is documented, and require later
rounds that lean on such a join to state the candidate count as a fraction rather than quoting it
as if it were narrow.

## Before reverting a raised apply, establish WHICH SIDE IS AHEAD

The standing repair for an apply that raised is *do not promote its output — revert the artifacts it
touched, by name.* That rule is right, and it encodes an assumption worth making explicit: **the
artifacts ran ahead of the program.** Which is the normal failure, because artifacts are written
last, after the program mutation has already succeeded.

There is a second shape, and the standing rule makes it worse rather than better.

**Measured.** A script renamed five symbols, rewrote both its side ledgers, then raised on a mistyped
cascade call. Program and ledgers had moved **together** and agreed with each other exactly; only the
cascade and the post-cascade re-assert had not run. Reverting the ledgers there would have
**manufactured** the desync the rule exists to prevent — turning a consistent, unfinished state into
an inconsistent one.

- **Diff the program against the ledger before deciding.** The correct repair is whichever action
  restores agreement. Sometimes that is finishing the operation, not undoing it.
- **The rule is about CONSISTENCY, not about undoing.** "Revert on raise" is a heuristic for the
  common case; the invariant underneath it is that the program and its ledger must agree.

## An applier that REWRITES rows must be convergent from the start

Most appliers append: a row is written once and never touched again, so a half-finished run always
leaves the artifact ahead of or behind the program in a detectable way. An applier that **rewrites**
existing rows is different — a partial run can leave both sides consistent, and then re-running is
the natural repair rather than a hazard.

So write it to converge: **a target that already carries the intended value is a corroboration, not
a conflict.** Skip it and continue. This is the same three-way guard a good applier already uses to
tolerate a name it applied in an earlier session (*present and correct → skip; present and different
→ raise; absent → apply*), and it costs three lines.

Written that way, the incident above would have been a re-run rather than a diagnosis. Written the
other way, a raise leaves an operation that **cannot be completed except by hand** — which is how a
careful project ends up hand-editing a ledger.

### An applier whose population rule is the condition its own apply DESTROYS cannot converge

The previous section says every mutating applier needs a state meaning *"already exactly what I
would write"*. Here is the way that state can be present, correct-looking, and **unreachable by
construction** — with nothing in the code to show it.

**Measured.** An applier promoted a ground-truth symbol to primary at every address whose primary
was a placeholder. Its population rule was, in full, *"an address carrying an authoritative symbol
whose primary is placeholder-shaped."* It applied cleanly over four addresses, every guard passed,
the invariant bracket held, the post-cascade re-assert held. A bare re-run then raised
`VACUITY: 0 shadowed addresses` **on its own successful output** — because promoting the real name
is exactly what stops an address being shadowed. The apply had consumed its own population.

The three-state machine was there. `already` could never be entered: an address in that state no
longer satisfies the membership predicate, so it is not a candidate to be classified.

- **Reading the applier does not reveal this.** The branch is syntactically reachable and
  semantically dead, and every review of the code says it handles the re-run case. What reveals it
  is *running the applier a second time* — which is the argument for a bare re-run being a standing
  step after every apply rather than a nicety.
- **The fix is the rule this file already states, pointed at a new symptom:** derive the population
  from a **repo** fact. Here, the union of the program-derived set and the human-approved census.
  That rule was written for partial-failure resume; it is the same fix, and noticing that saved
  designing a second one.
- **The vacuity guard has to move with the rule.** *"Zero candidates is a rule fault"* is true only
  before the round runs. The check that survives an apply is *"zero to write AND zero already"* —
  otherwise the guard that protects you from a broken rule becomes the thing that fails on success.

Ask it of any applier whose predicate mentions the state it writes: **if this runs to completion,
does its own selection still find these rows?** A predicate over *what is missing* answers no.

### A print is not a write

**Measured.** A mutating applier ended with
`print("LEDGER: append these rows to <ledger>")` and left the append to a human. The apply landed
two agent-tagged symbols the ledger did not carry — precisely the both-directions provenance
invariant the project's gates exist to catch. Nothing in the applier failed; it reported success,
and the discrepancy existed for exactly as long as it took someone to read the output and act on
it. Had the output been long, or the session ended, the gate would have caught it later and the
round would have looked like collateral damage rather than an unfinished step.

**An applier that instructs a human to finish it has not finished.** The ledger append belongs
inside the same run as the mutation. Two details make that safe:

- **Write it convergently** — skip a row already present for this key — so a re-run cannot
  accumulate duplicates.
- **Expect the fix to expose a second defect in the apply itself.** Making the ledger re-runnable
  forces the *program* side to be re-runnable too, and there the trap is that
  `createLabel`/`setName` with a value already present is a **silent no-op**. A delta bracket of
  the form `symbols == before + N` then raises on a program that is already correct. Count what
  the run actually writes, not what its census contains.

### Creating a function makes its whole body visible to every function-walking sweep at once

**Measured.** One function created at previously-unclaimed bytes changed **four** committed
artifacts. Two were expected (the symbol inventory, and the string inventory's "referenced from no
function" cell). One was a bonus corroboration. The fourth was a survey of virtual-dispatch sites,
which gained **three** rows — dispatch sites that had always been in those bytes and were invisible
only because the bytes belonged to no function.

**Budget the artifact churn of a function-creating apply against the BODY, not against the one row
you meant to add.** Every sweep in the project that iterates defined functions now sees an
additional body's worth of instructions, and each will report whatever it is built to find there.

The upside is real and worth expecting rather than being surprised by: two of those four changes
were *corroborations arriving free* — an independent sweep reported the new body has the structural
shape its claimed role requires, which is a witness nobody had to design. And where the sweep names
functions, check the change shows your name **filtered out**: seeing the agent-name filter visibly
suppress your own fresh name in a regenerated artifact is the anti-circularity rule being exercised
rather than merely present.

### When a gate refuses your row, change the row's HOME before you change the gate

**Measured, twice in one round, and both refusals were right.** A round wrote a recovered 16-byte
type into the program and then had to record it. The first artifact it tried was the project's
decided-types file, on the strength of an earlier round's note saying *"adding a row here is an
approved step"*. The type gate raised: every row in that file is joined against a harvested
evidence file which the project may not regenerate, and the type in question had been discovered
in a later phase with no such evidence. The second was the field-type-upgrade file, on a precedent
that matched the situation exactly in substance — an exported member accessing a block cell at
element width, with an in-body element-count bound. That gate raised too: its guard verifies
`element_size * N == span` **from the ctype string**, so it accepts only scalar element names and
cannot size a struct.

Widening the second guard's pattern was one line. It would have been wrong, and the reasons
generalise:

- **A guard in a producing sweep is a rule, and changing it owes the full two-step diff and its
  own poison.** That cost is worth paying when the rule is wrong. It was not wrong; it was simply
  built on a mechanism (string arithmetic) that cannot express this case.
- **It was unnecessary.** A third committed artifact — the one whose stated purpose is that *"a
  rebuild-from-artifact is only safe if every decision lives in an artifact"* — already resolved a
  ctype's base through the type manager and built arrays from it, so it accepted the row unchanged.
- **The test to run first:** is there another committed artifact whose consumer already takes this
  row as written? If yes, the guard is not the problem and the row is in the wrong file.

Two smaller things fell out of the same round:

- **A note that authorises an artifact write grants the PERMISSION and does not settle the HOME.**
  *"Adding a row to X is an approved step"* is a statement about sign-off. Whether the row belongs
  in X is a separate question with its own answer, and the gate is the thing that knows it.
- **Verify the retreat.** After reverting both rejected appends, the check that the withdrawal was
  clean rather than approximate is that both files are **byte-identical to the base revision** and
  appear in no diff. A revert that leaves a stray blank line or a re-ordered row is a content
  change nobody adjudicated.

### A report that cannot see the effect it claims to measure is worse than no report

**Measured.** An applier ended with a section printing each affected function's signature, to show
the payoff: a 16-byte by-value return should switch to the hidden return-storage-pointer
convention. It printed `getPrototypeString(...)`, which omits both `this` and the hidden return
pointer — so it rendered the identical string before and after, while the committed symbol
artifact recorded the parameter count going **1 → 2** with the storage pointer added. The round's
genuine result read as a non-result, and was only recovered by diffing the artifact.

- **Pick the accessor by what it is documented to include**, not by which name reads best. Where a
  compiler-introduced parameter is the thing you are looking for, walk the parameter list (which
  includes auto-params) rather than a formatted prototype string.
- **When a predicted effect appears not to have happened, suspect the instrument before the
  prediction.** A silent report and a real non-event are indistinguishable from inside the script,
  and one cheap artifact diff separates them.

### Predict the datatype delta with an account BY NAME, before the run

Same round: predicted `+1` and got `+1`, where the naive reading says `+2`. The apply wrote a
struct **and** an array of it, but the struct already existed as a demangler-created 1-byte
placeholder and was **edited in place**, so only the array was new. That is knowable before
running — check whether each type you are about to write already exists — and it converts the
bracket from something you re-pin after the fact into something that confirms your model of what
the apply does.

### An option's label and its description must make the same promise

**Measured, and the failure is in the asking rather than the answering.** A census option was
presented to a human as *"add a shared typedef too"* while its description offered only *"record
in the artifact that these elements share a domain"* — a type versus a note, with the more
attractive wording on the label. The human chose quickly, then came back to ask what the typedef
had been. That is how the mismatch surfaced at all.

The whole point of approving a census **to the row** is that the approval is informed. A label
that promises more than its description delivers defeats that, and no amount of accuracy further
down repairs it: **the label is what gets read.**

- **Write the label at the same specificity as the description.** If the label names a mechanism
  ("typedef", "retype", "rename"), the description must propose that mechanism.
- **Treat a fast answer as a reason to re-read your own option, not as evidence it was clear.**
- When the discrepancy is found, put the choice again and say plainly that the first framing was
  wrong — do not quietly deliver the more attractive reading on the grounds that it was chosen.

## An applier needs a FORWARD recovery, not only a rollback

The rule *"an applier whose post-check can raise must ship its recovery"* is usually read as *ship a
revert*. Half the failures need the other direction. Measured: an applier mutated 23 functions, ran
its cascade, **passed its first post-check**, and then crashed in the *second* on a variable-name
clash with the scripting bridge — leaving the program correct, verified, and ahead of its ledger.
Reverting a correct mutation in order to re-apply it identically is churn, not safety.

So ship a **`finish` mode**: re-run every post-check and append the ledger, mutating nothing. Two
details make it trustworthy:

- Take its control-group baseline from the **committed artifact**, not from an in-memory capture —
  the artifact survives the crash, the capture is exactly what was lost.
- It must still be able to *fail*. `finish` re-asserts the applied state rather than assuming it; a
  half-applied program must not be ledgered as complete.

The same round supplies the reason the snapshot must exist at all: **write the BEFORE state to the
artifact before the first mutation**, never to a local. Here it was already on disk when the crash
happened, so nothing was lost.

## A gate that REGENERATES artifacts can revert a repair between adjudication and commit

Measured, and it cost a commit. A round repaired a defect in a committed artifact, diffed it, and
adjudicated the change. The stability gate — which regenerates most committed artifacts to prove they
are reproducible — then ran, **silently overwrote the repaired file with the defective output**, and
the round committed that. The commit undid its own fix. It surfaced only because the gate was re-run
*afterwards* and compared against the commit.

**Rule: a green gate run before `git add` says nothing about what was actually staged. Re-run any
artifact-regenerating gate AFTER committing, and diff against the commit.**

## A harness that EXECs source files must open them with an explicit encoding

The root cause above is worth its own line, because it is invisible and it breaks the one property
such a harness exists to guarantee. The gate loaded each producer's source with a bare
`open(path).read()`. The disassembler's own script provider decodes scripts as **UTF-8**; a bare
`open()` uses the platform's locale default, which on a Windows host is **cp1252**. A single non-ASCII
character in a producer's source therefore arrived mangled, and the producer — correctly encoding its
output as UTF-8 — wrote it back **double-encoded**.

Two consequences. **The same script produced different bytes down the two execution paths**, which is
precisely the byte-identity property the gate was built to test. And an encoding check over the
artifacts could not see it: double-encoded text is *valid* UTF-8, so a gate asserting
**decodability** passes on it forever. **Assert what you mean: decodable is not correct.**
## A pre-mutation snapshot must be APPEND-ONLY, or the second round destroys the first round's recovery

The rule *"capture the BEFORE state into the artifact before mutating"* has a failure mode that shows
up on its second use, not its first.

Measured: an applier wrote its pre-mutation snapshot with an overwriting write. Re-pointed at a later
round's three targets, it would have replaced the previous round's twenty-three rows — that round's
*only* revert source — with three, **while executing the very rule that exists to make recovery
possible**. The safety mechanism was about to erase its own history, and the dry run looked perfect
because the snapshot it wrote was correct for the rows it knew about.

Make it append-only and give every row the round that wrote it; make `revert` filter on that column.
Then backfill the existing rows with theirs, so the file is consistent rather than half-labelled.

**The general rule: any artifact whose purpose is recovery is append-only and self-identifying. An
overwriting safety mechanism is not one.**


## Look for the smaller change before you accept the blast radius

A queued item can be right about the risk and wrong about where the change has to go, and the
warning about blast radius is what stops anyone looking for a cheaper site.

Measured. A project's construction-body scanner tracked "which registers provably hold the object
pointer at offset 0" — a set several sweeps, appliers and diagnostics all read. Member sub-objects
are constructed through `LEA ECX,[this+K]`, which by design never enters that set, so a chain walk
driven by it could not follow them and a large fraction of every class's storage went unwitnessed.
The backlog scoped the fix as *"make the set offset-aware"*, correctly noted that it was shared by
a dozen consumers, and required a two-step old-rule-vs-new-rule diff with the old rule run live.

The set did not need changing. The same function already carried a **parallel** alias tracker
resolving `reg -> this + delta` for an unrelated side channel, and the call branch already ran
before the caller-saved registers were cleared — so the offset could simply be *read* at the site
the old rule was rejecting. What shipped was a new key appended at an existing site, with a
perturbation surface that was **empty by construction**; the two-step diff then confirmed that
rather than discovering it.

So: when a change looks like it must touch shared machinery, **enumerate what the function already
computes before you change what it computes.** A side channel added for one purpose is often the
capability the next round needs, and the cost of checking is one read of the file.

## Document what a rule cannot witness, beside the rule that makes it sound

The same module explained, correctly and at length, *why* the offset-0 discipline is sound —
member constructors receive `LEA ECX,[this+K]`, a class with its own vfptr cannot embed a member at
offset 0, therefore the set is trustworthy. What it never said is the consequence: that every byte
a member constructor writes is invisible to any consumer driven by that set, **by construction**.

The cost of the omission was not a wrong number, it was a *misread* one. The producer emitted a
3,152-byte region marked `unknown` — it had seen the region and could not name it — and downstream
that read as "nobody has looked here yet" rather than "this instrument cannot look here". Four
months, and a class scoring 7% coverage that nobody re-opened.

A soundness argument names a blind spot whether or not it says so. **Write the blind spot down in
the same comment**, in the vocabulary a coverage report uses, so the honest `unknown` in the
artifact can be traced back to the rule that guarantees it.

## A deferral is only honest if something can find it again

It is often right to apply markup that is correct but incomplete — a struct with an undefined
region, a field typed by width and not by meaning, a layout flattened from an ancestor because the
immediate base's extent is unknown. Claiming less than you know is the whole discipline. But
"we'll revisit this when we know more" is a promise that decays the instant the round ends, unless
the revisiting is mechanised.

The cheap mechanism is a **worklist artifact**: one committed row per deferred decision, carrying
the identity of the thing deferred, the exact region affected, and what was used instead.
Measured: 21 structs were built from an ancestor rather than their immediate base because three
base sizes are unrecoverable; each skip became a row of `(class, skipped base, gap lo, gap hi,
prefix actually used)`. When one of those sizes later becomes measurable, the affected structs are
a **query**, not an archaeology exercise — and the applier's state machine already refreshes a
flattened prefix whose source has changed, so the rebuild is a re-run rather than a new round.

Three properties make it work, and the third is the one usually missed:

- **The row names the region, not just the class.** "This class is approximate" is not actionable;
  "bytes [840, 872) of this class are undefined because sizeof(X) is undecided" is.
- **The row names what was used instead**, so a later reader can tell a deliberate substitution
  from an omission.
- **The artifact is covered by whatever checks your committed artifacts** — reach model, encoding
  gate, stability canary. An uncovered worklist is a text file that silently stops being
  regenerated, which is the same as not having written it.

An undefined region plus a sentence in a commit message makes exactly the same claim about the
binary and none of the claims about the future.

## Split an apply by RISK CLASS, so stronger evidence cannot launder weaker

When a round has several changes to make and they all pass their checks, the efficient-looking
move is one apply with one census. Resist it whenever the changes rest on **different witnesses**.
A single census makes the population look homogeneous, and if one subset later proves wrong there
is no way to attribute the failure — the strong evidence and the weak evidence shipped together
under one number.

Measured. 76 signatures were repaired in one round and deliberately applied as two:

- **58 `__fastcall` → `__thiscall`.** Both conventions pass argument 1 in the same register, so
  the relabel is *abi-identical* — it renames what the code already does. The witness is a
  liveness probe showing the second register carries nothing.
- **18 `__stdcall` → `__thiscall`.** This *adds* a parameter the signature never modelled, which
  is a claim **about** the ABI rather than a relabelling of it. The witness is entirely different:
  sibling implementations of the same vtable slot dereferencing the object register.

Two censuses, two approvals, and a **checkpoint between them**, so the program has a named version
in which the safe half is applied and the risky half is not. If the second half ever has to be
reverted, the revert target exists and is not entangled with the first.

The test is not "how confident am I" but **"if this subset turned out to be wrong, would I be able
to tell which evidence failed, and could I undo it alone?"** If the answer to either half is no,
it is a separate census.

## When one operation makes two claims, say which one carries the risk

Some applies are a single call that asserts two independent things. Setting a `__thiscall`
convention with an empty formal parameter list, for instance, does a *convention relabel* and a
*parameter retype* at once, because the disassembler then derives the implicit `this` from the
function's parent class. Written up as "we relabelled 78 signatures", the round looks uniform. It
is not:

- the **relabel** is ABI-identical — both conventions pass argument 1 in the same register — so its
  only claim is that the *second* register carries nothing, which register liveness decides
  mechanically and independently;
- the **retype** rests entirely on the parent namespace naming the right class, and on a binary
  with no RTTI and no debug records that namespace is *your own prior inference*.

Separating them is what tells you which witness the round actually needs. Once written down, the
question "what corroborates the namespace, other than us?" has an obvious answer — the set of
classes whose vtable holds the body, which comes from the binary — and it stops being optional.

**And make that rule DIRECTIONAL rather than exclusive.** The tempting form is "a body appearing in
several classes' vtables means the attribution is unreliable, refuse it." That is wrong: a base
method appearing in 21 subclass vtables *is* the defining class's method — the slot is inherited,
not ambiguous. The correct form is *the claimed owner must be an ancestor-or-self of every class
whose vtable holds the body*. Measured, the directional rule kept 10 rows the exclusive one would
have discarded while still refusing 4 that genuinely contradicted the namespace.

Two mechanical notes that cost a guard each:

- An empty formal list means the tool injects the implicit parameter **and nothing else**, so a
  body that really takes further stack arguments has them silently DELETED. No count notices —
  functions, symbols and types all stay put while the prototype quietly narrows. Refuse any target
  with more than one modelled parameter rather than truncating it.
- Re-assert **after** the cascade. An AI-tier signature is exactly what the demangler and the
  analyzer are free to overwrite, since those tiers rank equal.

## A metric moving the WRONG WAY can be the recovered layout finally telling the truth

After applying a type, expect some quality metrics to get worse, and read the mechanism before
calling it a regression.

Measured. Typing 78 `this` pointers moved the good numbers hard — index expressions through the
wrong type **998 → 0**, member accesses through the object **4 → 1708**, named (non-placeholder)
fields **988 → 1725**, with 78 of 78 bodies improving. In the same measurement, *undefined locals*
over those bodies **rose 167 → 334**, 40 bodies worse against 5 better.

Both easy write-ups were wrong. "Cascade noise" is refuted by the control group, which held at
190 → 190 across the same re-analysis. "The apply degraded the decompilation" is refuted by the
body itself: `undefined1 *puVar1 = &this->field_0xf0;` — the new undefined locals come from taking
the address of struct fields **not yet recovered**. Before the apply the decompiler had no struct
to consult and *guessed* a type from usage; afterwards it propagates the layout's own honesty about
which bytes are still unknown.

So the number is real, it is caused by the apply, and it is not a regression: it is the recovered
type refusing to invent what it does not know. **The worsened bodies become a query for the next
field-recovery round** — they name exactly the classes whose layouts have the most unrecovered
span. Report it at the same weight as the wins; a round that only reports the metrics that moved
its way is choosing its own scoreboard.

## A recovery record a later run of the same script deletes is not a recovery record

Applies that write a pre-mutation snapshot — the old prototype, the old type, the old name — usually
write it with a plain overwrite, because the script was conceived as running once. Scripts that
apply an approved census get run again for the *next* approved census, and the second run silently
destroys the first round's only pre-apply state.

Measured. An applier ran twice, for two separately approved censuses. The second run replaced 78
snapshot rows with 57. Nothing was actually lost — every one of the 78 old prototypes was
byte-identical in the append-only apply ledger, verified row by row — but that was luck, not design:
the ledger happened to carry the same field. The fix is either a file per round (which is what the
same project's other snapshots do, and it shows in their names) or one **append-only** file keyed by
round and version, which is the shape the apply ledger already has.

Generalise it: **any artifact written by a script that can legitimately run more than once should be
append-only, or keyed so a second run cannot address the first run's rows.** And when you find one
that was not, check whether the lost data is recoverable elsewhere *before* concluding damage — and
say plainly that recovery was luck rather than design, so the fix does not get filed as optional.


## A new VALUE in a column something gates on is a schema change

Adding a new confidence label to an artifact looks additive — the column already exists, the
header does not move, every row still parses. It is not additive, because consumers gate on the
SET of values, not on the column:

```python
HUB_SIZE_CONFIDENCE = ("bounds_pinned",)          # and deliberately nothing else
DECIDED_LABELS      = ("bounds_pinned", "own_alloc", "ai_decided")
```

Measured on one project: a round introduced a new label for a new witness, and because that
witness also fired on five rows already decided by another route, those five were RELABELLED. The
sizes did not change by a byte. A downstream producer nevertheless stopped seeing five classes and
raised, because its allowlist admitted the old label and not the new one — and the exclusion was
deliberate, not an oversight, so widening it would have been the wrong repair too.

Two rules, and the second is the one that generalises furthest:

- **Before introducing a value into a column, grep for the allowlists.** They are literal tuples
  and they are scattered; in that project six sites gated on the same vocabulary, of which two
  would raise, three would silently skip, and one silently misclassified a result into a
  neighbouring bucket. Report them as *raises* versus *silently skips* — the silent ones are the
  ones that cost you a round later.
- **A new witness must not relabel a row it did not decide.** Where an existing rule already
  reaches the same value, leave the row's label alone and record the new witness's agreement in
  the row's note. That is strictly better than the relabel: it keeps every downstream consumer
  working, and it puts the corroboration in the artifact instead of replacing the label that
  carried it.

The same shape has been seen for a new KEY (a new class or table id propagating into a channel
that keys on it). A new value is the same event in a narrower place, and it is harder to spot
precisely because nothing about the file's shape changes.

## A rebuild is a deletion of everything not in the plan

The common shape for applying a recovered struct is *build a fresh type from the plan, then swap
it in* — in Ghidra, `dtm.replaceDataType(old, freshly_built, true)`. It reads as an update. It is
a replacement: **every component of the old type that the plan does not reproduce is gone**, and
nothing in the call says so.

This survives a long time by accident. Measured on one project: an applier had used exactly that
path for dozens of program versions without ever losing anything, because the classes carrying a
component from *some other round* always classified "already equal to the plan" in its state
machine and were therefore never rebuilt. The safety property was held by the **state machine**,
not by the apply, and nobody had written it down. One upstream change — an unrelated artifact
gaining a field, so a plan gained a cell — moved one class out of that state, and the rebuild
became reachable with another round's in-place work in its path. A precondition refused, which is
the only reason this is a lesson and not an incident.

**The rule.** When a mutating step REPLACES a whole object rather than editing it in place,
enumerate what the replacement does not carry, and assert it. "The plan is complete" is not a
statement about your plan; it is an assumption about every other round that has ever touched the
same object. Three things make it cheap:

- **Classify every live component before allowing a rebuild**, into *replaced* (inside the planned
  ranges — and permitted only if it is anonymous or keeps its name, so a rebuild cannot silently
  rename recovered work), *carried* (outside them), and *straddling the edge* — which must
  **refuse**, because half of it would be rebuilt and half dropped and nothing can say which half
  was decided.
- **Re-place the carried components verbatim** after the plan's own, exactly as a flattened base
  prefix is copied.
- **Reuse the tolerance predicate you already have.** If a post-apply check already decides which
  unplanned components are legitimate, call that same function pre-apply rather than writing a
  second rule; a tolerance rule with two homes will diverge.

The tell that you are exposed: an apply that constructs a new object from a plan and hands it to a
replace/swap API, in a codebase where more than one round can touch the same object.

## A WIDTH-PRESERVING type apply is not layout-neutral — ask what it makes DECIDABLE

Everything else on this page is about an apply that moves bytes: a wider field, a collateral
deletion, a rebuild that drops what was not in the plan. **The apply that needs no width check at
all is the one with no width story.** Measured: a 64-byte opaque cell was retyped from
`uint8_t[64]` to `Vec[4]`. Sixty-four bytes before, sixty-four after. Nothing tiled differently, no
coverage denominator moved, `sizeof` was untouched, and it was the safest-looking write of the
round.

It had two consequences nobody predicted, and neither is visible to a width- or coverage-based
check.

**It made a loop LEGIBLE for the first time, and a producer read the new legibility wrong.** A body
the binary itself names — at a *non*-destructor slot in 32 vtables — walks that array with
`ADD EBX,0x10` and a literal trip count of 4. Before the retype the element type was illegible and
the decompiler's simplification decided nothing; the committed artifact holds the near-miss with
`why=rejected_empty`. After it, `0x10` arrived as a PTRADD element size, and **16 was minted as an
exact size witness for two classes whose real sizes are 1400 and 1148.** The apply did not create
the defect; it removed the illegibility that had been *suppressing* it.

**And it left the same cell stale in every flattened copy** — 22 of them, taking two further
applies, because refreshing a base exposes its descendants and the second wave is larger than the
first probe reports.

The rule: **before any type apply, enumerate the producers that scan that cell and ask what each
one can now decide that it could not decide before.** A cell nothing could read is a cell nothing
could read *wrong*. Retyping it hands every scanner a new operand, and the scanners whose scope was
never enforced (see `harvesting-traps.md` on a docstring claiming a scope the code lacks) will read
it at once. Expect the flattened-copy cascade to be larger than predicted, and re-run the drift
probes after *any* base-struct edit, width-preserving or not.

## A multi-token applier's invariant pin is PER-SESSION, not per-round

The invariant bracket above assumes the BEFORE value was measured before anything in this round
ran. That assumption breaks the moment one applier has more than one token and the tokens run
hours apart. Measured: an applier pinned `datatypes` at 1641 and refused its second token, because
the *first* token of the **same round** had minted two types an hour earlier. The pin was correct
and the refusal was the bracket working.

Two consequences:

- **A pin derived from a previous round's BEFORE value is stale the moment any sibling token
  runs.** Two tokens of one applier are not independent inside one session.
- **Re-pinning is legitimate only with the reason recorded in the file** — "re-pinned to 1643
  after establishing that the `prebuild` token minted two types", never a silent bump to make a
  run go green. Write that sentence into the applier's own refusal message, so the next person to
  hit it is told which of the two things they are doing.

## A repair WIDER than its census is an unapproved apply wearing an approved one's write-up

When a census licenses a repair, it licenses a blast radius, and the radius is whatever the census
actually measured — not whatever the defect touches.

Measured. A scanner replaced its object-alias tracker on every allocator call, and the same
replacement governed four distinct outputs: the per-offset cell list, the two access maxima, the set
of registers treated as holding the object, and the call receivers derived from that set. The census
diffed the **first two**. Repairing all four was one variable away and would have changed class
hierarchy derivation and class attribution — with no census at all, in the same commit, under the
same write-up.

So the repair touched the two channels the census covered and left the others alone, with the reason
in the code. The remaining half became its own queued round with its own differential.

The test to apply before widening a fix: **for each output the defect touches, did the census measure
it?** If not, the honest move is two rounds. It feels like hesitation and it is the difference between
a change somebody approved and a change that merely shipped next to one.

## A `note` COLUMN IS PROSE AND ROTS LIKE PROSE — no check reads it

Evidence artifacts grow a human-readable `note` or `reason` column, written once when the rule
had one branch. It is the line a reader of the CSV actually sees, and **nothing joins against
it**, so it is the least defended text in the repository.

Measured. Every pinned row of a size artifact said *"is within alignment of the descendant alloc
floor"*. Over the 27 pinned rows at the time of the audit: **17 were true**, **5 had been false
for twenty-four rounds** — since a second witness became a possible source of that bound — and 5
more would have been false from the round doing the audit. The round that introduced the second
source had fixed the adjacent *raise* to name its source, with the reasoning *"a raise that
misattributes its own evidence sends the next reader to the wrong artifact"*, and left the note
untouched.

- **When a value can come from more than one witness, the note must name the witness**, not a
  category the value used to belong to. Interpolate the source variable; do not restate it.
- **Audit notes when you add a producer of an existing quantity.** The same sweep that greps for
  messages naming the old producer as the only one should grep the note templates.
- Accept that this cannot be gated cheaply, and prefer notes that are *derived* from the same
  variable the decision used, so a wrong note requires a wrong decision.

---

## A COMMENT THAT NAMES A CAUSE IS A MEASUREMENT, AND IT DECAYS LIKE ONE

The note-column entry above is about prose inside artifacts. This is the same failure one layer
up, in the code comments a reader trusts *more*, and it is worse there because the comment usually
names a **culprit**.

Two measured cases from one round, both attached to guards that are still correct:

- A sweep refuses a class because a scan returns the wrong table, and the comment records the
  cause as *"[this artifact]'s column is a join, not ground truth."* Re-measured: the artifact's
  row is **right**, and the scan is wrong. The class had been losing a recovery route to an
  innocent artifact's reputation, and any later round reading that comment would have gone to
  audit the wrong file.
- A narrowing was justified by *"the constructor builds an EMBEDDED member through a second
  register, and the tracker had lost that register's delta."* Re-measured: the register holds a
  **fresh heap allocation** three instructions after the allocator call, its size immediate
  matching the allocated class's own construction extent to the byte. There was no delta to lose,
  because the pointer is not relative to the object at all.

Both narrowings survived; both stated reasons were wrong, and each pointed the next reader
somewhere useless. **A comment that says WHY is an empirical claim with a date on it.** When a
round measures one of them false, correct it in the same commit even if no behaviour changes —
and prefer comments that cite a re-derivable command or artifact over ones that assert a
mechanism, so the claim can be re-run rather than re-believed.

## A RAISED SCRIPT COMMITS WHAT RAN BEFORE THE RAISE — rehearse past the first mutation, and roll back on raise

Measured on one 1999 MSVC/x86 binary, Ghidra 12.1.2 through PyGhidra: an applier dry-ran clean
against every live guard and three poison arms, then raised in its second stage on an API call written
from memory -- a line no dry run reached, because the dry run stops before the first mutation. The
script manager **committed** the first stage anyway: a read-back probe found 249 of 249 function
signatures changed, a partial type build, no cascade, no ledger rows, an **empty undo stack** and
`isChanged()` true. An undo-last-transaction recovery had nothing to undo; the only exact way back was
closing the program without saving and re-measuring the saved version.

Two changes close it, and the second must be exercised, not assumed:

- **Rehearse the post-mutation code in the dry run.** `StructureDataType(...)`, `FunctionDefinitionDataType(f, False)`
  and `PointerDataType(...)` build types in memory without touching the DataTypeManager, so a dry run
  can assemble every planned type and execute the API calls the apply will make. A dry run that only
  runs guards tests the guards.
- **Wrap the whole mutation section in `try: ... except: end(False); raise`.** `end(False)` aborts the
  script's own transaction. Demonstrate it with a mode that performs the real first stage and raises
  on purpose, then read the program back: every changed row must be in its pre-state.

Origin: re-metal-fatigue §421 (`notes/LESSONS.md`); the same "a dry run cannot test the code after
the mutation" failure had been recorded one round earlier, and recording it did not prevent it.

**A REVERT IS A MUTATION, and it is the path that gets written without the wrapper.** Measured again
(§468, Ghidra 12.3): an applier whose apply path carried the `try/except: end(False)` wrapper gained a
`revert` mode after its render trade lost, written in a hurry and outside that wrapper. Its first run
cleared a 256 KB array and re-created the old pointer, then raised on `DataTypeManager.remove(dt,
monitor)` -- an overload recalled from memory that does not exist (it is `remove(DataType)`). The
clear and re-create were committed. What recovered it cleanly was writing the revert to CONVERGE --
every step reads the state it finds and does only what is still undone -- and then proving the end
state by re-rendering: every function touching the global re-dumped, and only the ones the kept
changes explain differed from the pre-round corpus. Two rules: **every mutating mode, the undo
included, sits inside the wrapper**, and **a revert is written idempotent**, because the first time
it runs is usually the time something already went wrong.

## A NEW APPLIER INHERITS NONE OF THE REFUSALS THE OLD APPLIERS OF ITS KIND CARRY

A project policy that lives as a refusal inside each applier -- "a member name under a placeholder
class cannot be applied", enforced separately by a namespace-move applier, a slot-reconciliation
census and a citation verifier -- is invisible to the next applier written for a different reason. In
one project a census tool licensed four named functions into placeholder-class namespaces, the user
approved it, and only the post-apply witness run's citation verifier refused them; they were reverted
at the cost of a program version. The census re-derived the physics (conventions, liveness, stack
purge) from first principles and none of the policy.

Before writing an applier that moves names, namespaces or signatures, **search the existing appliers
and censuses of that kind for the rows they refuse, and give the new census every refusal it should
share** -- as a rule in the producer with a demonstrated arm, not a note. Origin: re-metal-fatigue §422.

## REHEARSE THE MUTATION TO PRICE IT — and give every API you write through for the first time its own gate

**A rehearsal is a census the decompiler grades.** Measured on one 1999 MSVC/x86 binary, Ghidra 12.1.2:
an applier's `rehearse` mode performed every retype inside the script transaction, re-decompiled the
functions it should change plus a control set it should not (bodies naming none of the classes
involved), printed the payoff, and called `end(False)`. The table the user approved -- overrun renders
64 -> 34, removed "unreachable" blocks 18 -> 0, 40 of 40 controls byte-identical -- was the decompiler's
own output, and the apply reproduced it row for row. Verify each rehearsal's rollback with the NEXT run
(`references/api.md`: the rollback lands when the outer transaction closes). Four rehearsals cost about
ten minutes and exposed three defects in the applier before approval, where they are cheapest. Dump the
C, not only counts: a count reaching 0 can be a raw `(*(code *)...)` render standing in for the defect.

**Retyping a decompiler local creates a provenance channel no symbol-based gate reads.**
`HighFunctionDBUtil.updateDBVariable(highSymbol, None, dt, SourceType.AI)` -- the call Ghidra's own
Retype Variable action makes -- commits a database variable tagged AI, and it also commits the
decompiler's current NAME with that source. The variable is NOT in `SymbolTable.getAllSymbols(True)`:
AI symbols by symbol type were identical before and after 14 commits. A ledger gate keyed on AI symbols
therefore cannot see a local appear off the books, vanish under re-analysis, or be retyped. Enumerate
`Function.getLocalVariables()` filtered on `getSource() == AI` against a ledger, both directions and by
type -- and demonstrate all three arms on a poisoned ledger copy.

**A parameter type change does not move the SIGNATURE source.** `updateDBVariable` on a parameter symbol
took the new type and `Function.getSignatureSource()` stayed ANALYSIS -- ungraded by a signature ledger
keyed on AI, and tied in priority with every analyzer that may rewrite it. Set it explicitly
(`setSignatureSource(SourceType.AI)`) and ledger the prototype.

**Re-assert the thing written, not the path that found it.** The applier located each object by tracing
the call site's CALLIND back through its first argument and the vtable-pointer load; after the commit the
same trace stopped resolving to a symbol at 16 of 22 sites, in functions whose renders had gone to 0. A
re-assert on that trace reports a working change as lost. Check the variable by name and the committed
database row.

Origin: re-metal-fatigue §423 (`notes/phase4-object-retypes.md`).

## TYPE THE CELL A LOCAL IS LOADED FROM BEFORE TYPING THE LOCAL — and a struct cannot fix a call on an under-typed object

Measured on one 1999 MSVC/x86 binary (Ghidra 12.1.2), two consequences of how virtual-call renders
repair:

- **A field retype propagates into the locals loaded from it.** A local living in hash (unique) storage,
  which a site-trace resolver could not reach, rendered correctly once the struct member it was cached
  from was retyped -- along with two more renders in another function. Rehearse the field first and
  count what propagation fixes before writing local rows for it.
- **Building a class's vtable struct does not repair a call on an object DECLARED as an ancestor.** The
  call keeps borrowing the ancestor struct's definition for that slot; when that borrowed definition has
  no parameters, the CALLIND has no `this` input at all, so a resolver keyed on the first argument cannot
  find the object even after the struct exists. The vtable-pointer load is then the only witness of the
  dispatching object. The prediction that the struct alone would fix it was wrong.

Origin: re-metal-fatigue §424 (`notes/phase4-object-retypes-2.md`).

## A DRY RUN THAT WRITES AN ARTIFACT IS A MUTATION — diff what it writes the first time its population changes

A dry run is supposed to be free. It is free for the *program*; an applier that also emits a
worklist or census artifact from its current plans is mutating the *repo*, and that write is only
harmless while every run plans the same population.

Measured on one project: a struct applier rewrote its "structs built from an ancestor" worklist on
every run, dry or not. For 30 program versions every run planned the same classes, so the file never
changed and its canary excuse read *"dry run regenerates it"*. The first run with a new population arm
planned four other classes and wrote **0 rows over the 21 committed** — the rebuild-is-a-deletion
shape, in a recovery artifact, from a dry run nobody expected to touch anything. It was caught by a
`git status` before staging, not by any gate: the artifact was excused from the stability canary
precisely because the dry run "regenerates" it.

- **When a producer's population rule changes, list the artifacts it WRITES and diff them after the
  first dry run**, not after the first apply.
- **A worklist or record artifact is merged, never overwritten**: rows for the things planned this
  run are replaced; every other committed row is carried verbatim; the run prints what the old rule
  would have written (the two-step diff, baked in).
- A canary excuse of the form *"the producer regenerates it"* is a claim that the producer's
  population is stable. Re-read it whenever that population gains an arm.

Origin: re-metal-fatigue §426.

### An applier run for ONE target applies to all of them

- **A generic applier invoked to create one type rebuilds its whole population.** Measured: the struct
  applier that was the right producer for one new embedded class would also have re-created every embedded
  element's vtable struct with a REPLACE conflict handler -- erasing slot definitions the previous round had
  typed -- and re-applied a stale cell nobody had approved. Its dry run said so (`stale=[...]`). Give the
  applier a narrowing argument that REFUSES an unknown target, rather than copying it for the one case.
- **A comment's invariant rots on the path nothing runs.** "The plan tuple is identical either way" stayed
  true until the tuple gained a type column; the create-new path that relied on it had not run since, and it
  raised on first use after writing half its changes (recovered by closing without saving). When a record
  gains a column, grep for the comments that promise equality over it.
- **Moving a function between two CLASS namespaces re-spells every ledgered prototype.** The auto-`this`
  follows the namespace, so a signature gate that tolerates `void` or the current class reads a class-to-class
  move as a partial revert. Ledger the move as its own signature row.

Origin: re-metal-fatigue §479.

## CUT A WIDE WAVE FROM A CAUSE CENSUS — and read a dry-run guard refusal as a missing census rule

**Origin: re-metal-fatigue §485 (2026-09-26).** Three good narrow rounds each aimed at one or two defects and paid the
full per-version verification tail. The wider round started from ONE pass over the per-function score artifact: for
every failing function, which defect causes fail it, and how many fail on exactly one (745 of 1,497). One read-only
investigator per cause priced its lane by simulating the fix with the grader's own code; builders built the lanes in
parallel, each followed by an adversarial verifier; all appliers went into ONE version bump. Measured: the lanes'
flip lists were disjoint, and the whole-program gain beat the sum of the lanes' rehearsals by exactly the functions
that needed two lanes' fixes at once -- gains a sequence of narrow rounds can only reach after all of them land.
Four of five cause investigators refuted their own lane's premise, and two lanes converged independently on the same
repair group, which is a strong selection signal.

**A verifier per builder is not ceremony.** It found blocking defects in 4 of 5 builds, including this project's own
applied names propagated into type component names (types carry no SourceType, so that launders them) and a selftest
reported green that was red. Its brief must require re-verifying sampled rows from the DISASSEMBLY, mutating two
guards on a copy, and checking the diff touches only the lane's files.

**When an applier's guard refuses at the first dry run, ask whether the offline census could have seen it.** Two did
here: a catalog rewrite that would have changed every line's terminator, and 47 planned data items whose bytes held
auto-analysis strings. The second was visible in the exported strings index all along, so the right fix was a census
rule (demonstrated by mutation) and a re-emitted plan -- never a hand-edited plan to get past the guard.

## TYPING A RECEIVER CAN BREAK A CALL THROUGH IT — and ask which GATE owns an artifact before adding a row

**Origin: re-metal-fatigue §486 (2026-09-27).** Replacing an opaque `base` byte array with the real base layout
typed a member that a virtual call went through. While the member was an untyped offset, the call's float return
bound; once the member was typed as a base-class pointer, the call's slot lay PAST that class's vtable and the
decompiler lost the return (`extraout_ST0`, a trustworthy-C regression). No slot was retyped -- only the receiver.
Any retype of a receiver can expose an out-of-range virtual call; rehearse with the artifact-variable grade on,
and hold the class (with the reason recorded in the census) until the call has a call-site prototype override.

**A file that looks like "where X lives" may be one phase's verified record.** Two new type sizes were appended to
a leaf-type file because a size reader read it; every downstream check passed and the gate that owns the file
refused 23 ways, because each of its rows must be witnessed in an evidence file that is never regenerated. The size
already had a decided home elsewhere. Before writing a row, find the gate that verifies the file, not the reader
that consumes it.

## THE CASCADE CAN RUN AN ANALYZER THAT WRITES `USER_DEFINED` — the Variadic Function Signature Override analyzer

**Measured (Ghidra 12.3, one MSVC/x86 game binary, 2026-09-27).** A signature apply changed one function's return
type and the apply's own `analyzeChanges` re-analysed that function. The **Variadic Function Signature Override**
analyzer — *enabled by default* — parsed the format strings of the function's 17 `printf` calls and wrote a call-site
prototype override at each one, as **`SourceType.USER_DEFINED`**: the tier a human decision carries, and the one a
`SourceType.AI`-filtered harvest treats as evidence. It recognised `printf` only because an earlier round of ours had
NAMED the CRT function (tagged AI) — so our own label came back out of the cascade as a top-tier override. That is a
laundering path the trust model's "tag your writes AI" rule does not close: the write is the analyzer's, not yours.

It had never fired before on that project for a structural reason — it runs on functions the cascade re-analyses,
and no earlier apply had re-typed a `printf` caller since the CRT names existed. So its absence across many rounds
proved nothing.

What caught it: a gate that checks **every** override label in the program against the apply ledger in BOTH
directions and requires `SourceType.AI` (17 unledgered labels + their `override` namespace, not AI). A gate keyed
only on the rows you wrote would have passed. What repaired it: a gated script that removes exactly the unledgered,
non-AI override labels inside functions that call a variadic CRT function (refusing anything else), and turns the
analyzer off (`currentProgram.getOptions("Analyzers").setBoolean("Variadic Function Signature Override", False)`)
so the next cascade cannot write them again. The information is recoverable from the format strings at any time; the
provenance is not.

Before relying on "the cascade only propagates what I applied", list the enabled analyzers that WRITE on a
function-changed event (`analysis_options` / `pyghidra.analysis_properties`) and ask which of them write a source tier
above `ANALYSIS`.
